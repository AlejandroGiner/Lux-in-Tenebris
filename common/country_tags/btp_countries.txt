#Cree Note - While no/almost no native 'nation' in North America had a governmental structure anything like what was found in the Old World, the Cree especially were rural, nomadic, discontinuous, and autonomous.
#Despite their massive range, numbers, and huge impact on the history of North America, they never really in the entire period had any sort of centralised government of a sort that merits an EU4 tag, 
#even compared to contemporary native groups who were much smaller, weaker, and less 'civilised'. Despite this, they have a tag in vanilla, based on internal files I'm guessing once even two were planned. It is also 
#one of the dominant cultures of North America, so I'm ----in this one instance---- throwing history out the window and giving the Cree a few tags, at least 2 in core start, and up to 7 more in the native start. 
#This will allow them to have the impact on both Europeans and other natives they historically did.
