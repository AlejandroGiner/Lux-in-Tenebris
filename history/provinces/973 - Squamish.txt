base_production = 4			#13k range for the Halkomelem, but I would suggest this is very low. Actual documented populations in the the early 19th century approach this number (still 3k-5k after another wave of disease in the early 19th) and between -at least- 2 major epidemics
base_manpower = 2			#in the previous 150 years (evidence for epidemics late 17th and mid-late 18th), certainly wiping out between 40 and 80 percent of the population each, and the ability of the area to support very large populations I would suggest more likely numbers at about 

native_size = 40				#60k in 1600, 18k in 1700, 9k in 1800, and 4k in 1850. I will concede to the possibility of something more like 30k in 1600, 10k in 1700, 5k in 1800, and 3k in 1850, but with current evidence I'd consider anything lower than this to be colonially tainted, and the
