#Kolomi. Also where the Kolomoki mounds are.
#Kolomoki mounds are Woodland era. Way old, no historic-era settlements that I know of around them the way other old mounds had continued settlement
#Don't know the etymology of Kolomoki even though these things are always named after something contemporary to their "discover"
#Maybe named after Kolomi subgroup of Creeks, who lived in the area early 18th century after the Yamassee wars before moving up to the Tallapoosa Upper Creeks and eventually moving south to merge with Seminoles in FL (Swanton)
#I honestly don't know what else to call the area.
