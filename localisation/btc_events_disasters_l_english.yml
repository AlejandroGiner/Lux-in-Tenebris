  flavor_ita.1.d: "As we are solidifying our claims on the Italian peninsula and striving to become the most important nation in the region, culturally and politically, the time has come to settle an issue many have brought up. Our peninsula has an extremely rich cultural tradition, with many notable works produced by poets, philosophers, scholars, kings and bishops, from Sicily to Piedmont. However, by far the most important centres of Italian cultures are in the middle of the peninsula: from Rome to Florence, with authors like Dante Alighieri or Niccolò Machiavelli, the cultural legacy of central Italy is unparalleled. Our nation however hails from the more distant $CAPITAL$, and we still proudly follow our [Root.Culture.GetName] traditions, as we should. However, some are suggesting that by switching over to the more renowned Tuscan language, we could more easily spread and adapt it to the rest of the Italian people that are coming under our rule, to better harmonize our state apparatus with their own and to become the representatives and true heirs of the cultural legacy of central Italy. Whilst this may cause unhappiness among certain circles back at home, the benefits will likely outweigh the cost. What shall we do?"

Following the bigger importance of the city in a regional level and the increasing demand of the famous Luni Marble of Carrara for renaissance art and building projects, the family created the "Office of Marble" in 1564 to regulate the marble mining industry.

  PriceChangesBTC.4.d: "Beginning in the 14th century, the whalers of northern Spain and southern France began expanding their fisheries and undertook 'seasonal trips' to the English Channel and southern Ireland. While the Basque controlled most whaling operations at the time, the lucrative market soon piqued the interest of European powers, with the English, Scandinavians and Dutch beginning to establish several whaling stations in the northern islands of Europe. These were set up in Britain, Norway, Iceland and several other places. The beginning of the age of exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries marked a significant increase in whaling activities as the newly discovered islands in the west became important whaling stations. The fisheries spread to Terranova (Labrador and Newfoundland) in the second quarter of the 16th century, where important stations were established at Red Bay and in Greenland. At this time England, France, the United Provinces and later Denmark-Norway shipped expert Basque whalemen for their expeditions. At that point, Basque whaling relied on the utilization of stations ashore where blubber could be processed into oil. Eventually the European powers would found their own whaling companies, resulting in conflict over fishing rights and a further expansion of whaling operations with the subsequent discovery of islands in the southern Atlantic sea."

  PriceChangesBTC.5.d: "Apiculture had always been an important market, considered a vital tradition to many cultures. During the medieval period abbeys and monasteries were centers of beekeeping, since beeswax was highly prized for candles and fermented honey was used to make alcoholic mead in areas of Europe where vines would not grow.\n\nHowever, it was not until the 18th century that European natural philosophers undertook the scientific study of bee colonies and began to understand the complex and hidden world of bee biology. From microscopes and dissection to understand internal biology of honey bees, to glass walled observation hives, to proving how bee queens are inseminated. The advances in bee-science were many and relevant, with François Huber being universally regarded as "the father of modern bee-science", thanks to his book "Nouvelles Observations sur Les Abeilles (or "New Observations on Bees"), which revealed all the basic scientific truths for the biology and ecology of honeybees.\n\nCollecting honey was a rudimentary and unhygienic process, which entailed the destruction of the entire colony when the honey was harvested, making it inefficient despite its lucrative market. Thanks to these scientific advances in bee biology, the 18th and 19th centuries saw successive stages of a revolution in beekeeping, which allowed the bees themselves to be preserved when taking the harvest.\n\nForeshadowed by Thomas Wildman in his 1768 book 'A Treatise on the Management of Bees', this gatekeeping practice revolution saw its completion in the 19th century by the American Lorenzo Lorraine, the first person to make practical use of Huber's earlier discoveries to create the movable-comb hive. The invention and development of the movable-comb-hive fostered the growth of commercial honey production on a large scale in both Europe and the US."

The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. For the Europeans the potato was regarded as a food for the natives and many thought it was poisonous: the conquistadors speak most favourably of the potato but they recommend it especially for the natives who have to do the heaviest jobs. A similar pattern is to be found in England where the potato became be the food of the working class. Thus, the potato was slow to be adopted by European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom."

Although there are yellow and gray variations, the most famed one is the white variation, which is characterised for the purity of its whiteness, reason for which it has been nicknamed 'white gold', which also correlates with the high lucrativeness of its extraction and comercialization.\n\nAlthough exploited since Antiquity by pre-Roman civilizations and possibly Phoenicians, it was during the Roman period that its use was well documented, with examples like the columns and structures of the amphitheatre of Mérida (then Emerita Augusta).\n\nIt continued to be extensively used during medieval times in andalusí art, prominently by the Cordobese and Granadan emirates, reaching its peak in professionalisation during the 13th century.\n\nAfter a brief stagnation following the Reconquista by Christian kingdoms and the decline of Nasrid Granada, it quickly gained popularity again during the renaissance and was used extensively by rulers of the Spanish Empire like the Catholic Monarchs or Carlos V for example, the latter using this marble for his palace."

Both scholars and related to prominent families, Martens was educated in the Aalst monastery of Hermits of Saint William whilst John studied in the University of Cologne.\n\nThey probably met in Venice around 1471, where Martens worked with another Flemish scholar, the humanist Gerardus de Lisa, from Ghent. It was then when Martens learnt the art of printing. The two decided to start a venture together and traveled back to Aalst, starting what would become the first printing press in the Southern Netherlands.\n\nAlthough the partnership ended in 1474 when Johan moved to Leuven to start his own printing press, Martens' printing press flourished and became an important publisher and editor, publishing books of many important figures of the time, such as books by Christopher Columbus, over 50 books by Erasmus, the very first edition of Thomas More's 'Utopia' and printing Enea Piccolomini's book, who later became Pope Pius II. Martens was also the first person to print Greek and Hebrew characters in the Netherlands.\n\nUpon John's death in 1498, Martens bought his shop and settled in Leuven, where he remained for the remanining of his professional career except for a decade he spent in Antwerp. In 1529 he moved back to Aalst where he died on 1534, around 88 years old.\n\nWhile there are other contenders for the title, he is often considered to be the first printer in Flanders and the importance of his work, especially his publications in Antwerp and Leuven, his role in the humanistic movement, and his contributions to the study of Greek and Hebrew, has been compared to the role Christoffel Plantijn played in Antwerp at the end of the 16th century."

One example of this is the case of the duchy of Burgundy, title ceded by Henry I to his brother Robert I. Many french kings, like Charles V, tried to remove the appanage system and hold a tighter grip in their domains, but in vain.\n\nIn 1566 an important royal ordinance was issued in Moulins under Charles IX, receiving the name of the Edict of Moulins. This ordinance dealt with many aspects of the administration of justice and feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, abrogation of the levy of rights of tallage claimed by seigneurs over their dependants and provisions for a system of concessions on rivers. This edict also declared that the royal domain could not be alienated except in a couple exceptional cases, such as the creation of an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. Therefore the apanagist could not separate himself from his appanage in any way.\n\nWhile this medieval system was not completely removed until the french revolution in the late 18th century, this edict greatly changed the influence French monarchs had in their domains and reduced the princes' influence over the royal domain considerably."

He has been labeled by later impressionist painters as 'painter of painters' and 'the greatest painter that has ever existed'.\n\nInfluenced by Caravaggio, an Italian painter, Velázquez developed a naturalist style with dramatic illumination in Sevilla, where he spent his first years. Velázquez was lucky enough to be contemporary of Gaspar de Guzmán, later count-duke Olivares, who advocated that Philip IV's court be composed mostly of Andalusians. So when Velázquez, being from Sevilla, moved to Madrid at age 24, he got recommended to Philip IV by one Olivares' followers. The young Philip IV, who was a patron of arts and had received drawing classes, immediately knew to appreciate the artistic gifts of Velázquez.\n\nWithin weeks, Velázquez was appointed the king's painter position and ordered to reside permanently in Madrid, a rapid rise that caused the resentment of the most veteran painters. Growing his trust with the king Velázquez asked Philip IV if he could travel to Italy to complete his studies, a dream many artists had at the time. Philip IV sent Velázquez with a servant and letters of recommendation for the authorities of the places he wanted to visit, which together to his position as king's painter, opened Velázquez many doors that were closed for lesser artists. This trip marked a decisive influence in Velázquez's style.\n\nHe returned to Spain with a superb technique, having studied the masterpieces of the Renaissance and the longest pictorial education any Spanish artist had received to date. Velázquez reached his maturity in style.\n\nAfter another trip to Italy he was appointed the highest position in the court, and his administrative chores started to weight. Nevertheless it was this last decade where Velázquez reached his pictorial peak, finishing works like 'Las Meninas', a superb and complex work which has long been recognised as one of the most important paintings in Western art history."

Murillo was a central figure in the prestigious school of Sevilla, with a noticeable amount of followers and disciples that made sure Murillo's influence would outlive him for decades after his death in 1682.\n\nA trait that differentiated him from other Spanish painters is that he was very well known outside Spain. Paintors like Velázquez, despite receiving higher praise and fame posthumously, weren't famous outside Spain during their lifetime beyond certain artistic circles in Italy. Murillo's distinct style, a very vivid mix of naturalism and realism attracted the eyes of many aristocrats, rich merchants and the common folk alike, with his paintings often bought and showed in Flemish and German private collections.\n\nA man of the clientele, the bulk of Murillo's work is comprised of religious paintings for Sevillian convents and churches, but unlike other great Spanish masters of the time, Murillo also develops a distinct taste for painting many petit genre paintings during all of his career."

His career as a teacher and author was very extensive for the time, since it covered more than half a century, from 1470 to 1522, the year of his death at 81.\n\nNebrija was a very influential figure in the academical world both in Castile and overseas, having been a driving force behind the efforts to revitalize the study of extant languages, as opposed to just focusing on Latin, efforts that other Romance languages would later follow.\n\nPerhaps the most innovative and revolutionary concept introduced by Nebrija was the usage of the Castillian language as a unifying factor for the feudal and scattered territories of the Catholic Monarchs, in fashion with contemporary Florentine figures such as Cristoforo Landino or Lorenzo de' Medici, who promoted Tuscan language to unify Italy.

  btc_misc.17.t:0 "Luis de Góngora"
  btc_misc.17.d:0 "Luis de Góngora y Argote was a Spanish poet and playwright during the Spanish Golden Age. Born in Córdoba in 1561, Góngora was the maximum exponent of the literary current known later, and with simplification perpetuated for centuries, as culteranismo or gongorismo. His work would be imitated throughout the centuries in Europe and America. Góngora's work would be so influential and important that it was subject to exegesis (interpretation or critical explanation of a text) already during his lifetime, a privilege very few authors have had across history.\n\nBorn to a noble family, Góngora enjoyed certain privileges during his early life that allowed him to study in the prestigious University of Salamanca, where he already developed some fame thanks to his poems. He maintained a long feud with contemporary Francisco de Quevedo, who matched him in talent and wit. Both poets composed lots of bitter, satirical pieces attacking one other, with Quevedo criticizing Góngora's penchant for flattery, his large nose, and his passion for gambling. Quevedo even accused his enemy of sodomy, which was a capital crime in 17th century Spain.\n\nThis angry feud came to a nasty end for Góngora when Quevedo bought the house he lived in for the only purpose of ejecting him from it. In 1626 a severe illness, which seriously impaired the poet's memory, forced him to return to Córdoba, where he died the next year in extreme poverty from trying to obtain positions and win lawsuits for all his relatives."

  btc_misc.18.d:0 "Francisco Gómez de Quevedo Villegas y Santibáñez Cevallos was a Spanish writer, poet and playwright during the Spanish Golden Age. Born in Madrid in 1580, Quevedo was one of the most distinguised author of Spanish literature, known specially for his poems, although he also wrote narrative, theater and various philosophical, political, moral, ascetic, humanistic and historical booklets. Quevedo was also Lord of a town in La Mancha where he would invite king Philip IV sometimes and knight of the Orden of Santiago.\n\nBorn to a family of hidalgos (lesser nobility), Quevedo had a solitary and sad childhood due to having been born crippled, with deformed feet and severe myopia, and was always surrounded by nobles, since his parents held high positions in the Court. Quevedo also had to go through heavy losses during his childhood, losing his father at 6 and his brother at 11.\n\nNonetheless, thanks to an unusual intelligence, Quevedo was taken to the Imperial College and for 4 years he studied classic languages, French, Italian, philosophy, physics, mathematics and theology in the University of Alcalá. Taking a break of a year, he continued his studies for another 4 years in the prestigious University of Valladolid. This is where Quevedo's lifelong feud with contemporary Luis de Góngora would start.\n\nLike with Góngora, Quevedo's popularity did not come from published work, but from handwritten copies, distributed with or without his consent. During his student life, he wrote in Spanish some burlesque, shameless and bad-tasting booklets, which despite making him popular, would leave an image of the author he did not desire. Quevedo then denounced them to the Inquisition not only to prevent them from spreading, but also to avoid printers getting rich at Quevedo's expense."

At 21 years old Tirso joined the Mercedarians, a Roman Catholic religious order, there, Tirso would study theology and arts, and would start his career as prominent writer and playwright.\n\nTirso stands out above all as a playwright, comprising mainly sitcom and hagiographic works. Tirso's work is very influential due to being the first author who gave psychological depth to female characters, who often became protagonists of his literary works, the abundance of them as well as the exploration of sexual issues.\n\nHis most notable work would be The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest, a play that for the first time reflects the myth of 'don Juan', the most universal character in Spanish theater."

He was one of the key figures in the Spanish Golden Age of Baroque literature. His reputation in the world of Spanish literature is second only to that of Miguel de Cervantes, while the sheer volume of his literary output is unequalled, making him one of the most prolific authors in the history of literature. He was nicknamed "The Phoenix of Wits" and "Monster of Nature" by Cervantes because of his prolific nature.\n\nLope de Vega renewed the Spanish theatre at a time when it was starting to become a mass cultural phenomenon. He defined its key characteristics, and along with Pedro Calderón de la Barca and Tirso de Molina, took Spanish Baroque theatre to its greatest heights. Because of the insight, depth and ease of his plays, he is regarded as one of the greatest dramatists in Western literature, his plays still being produced worldwide. He was also considered one of the best lyric poets in the Spanish language, and wrote several novels\n\nSome 3,000 sonnets, 3 novels, 4 novellas, 9 epic poems, and about 500 plays are attributed to him. Although he has been criticised for putting quantity ahead of quality, nevertheless at least 80 of his plays are considered masterpieces. Friend of Francisco de Quevedo and Juan Ruiz de Alarcón, antagonized with Luis de Góngora and in long rivalry with Cervantes, his life was as extreme as his work. He was the father of also playwright sister Marcela de San Felix. The volume of his lifework made him envied by not only contemporary authors such as Cervantes and Luis de Góngora, but also by many others like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who once wished he had been able to produce such a vast and colourful oeuvre."

Born when the Spanish Golden Age theatre was being defined by Lope de Vega, he developed it further, his work being regarded as the culmination of the Spanish Baroque theatre. As such, he is regarded as one of Spain's foremost dramatists and one of the finest playwrights of world literature.\n\nWith both his parents dying before Calderón coming to age, he had to interrupt his studies in the University of Alcalá and attend to his father's testament, which was contested between siblings and his stepmom. After resuming brief religious studies, Calderón decided to switch to a military career. After some legal and gambling problems, he saw himself forced to participate in military campaigns around Flanders and North Italy to pay his debts between 1623 and 1625.\n\nIt was then when after returning to Spain he began his literary career and started to gain fame. Merely a decade after he catches the attention of king Philip IV, a known patron of arts, who began to make commissions for the theaters of the Court."

Born in Candia in 1541, Greco spent the first 26 years of his life in Crete where he was an esteemed master of icons in the post-Byzantine style in force on the island. Greco then moved for ten years to Italy, where he came into contact with Renaissance painters; first in Venice, learning the style of Titian and Tintoretto, and then in Rome, studying the mannerism of Michelangelo. In 1577 he settled in Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked the rest of his life.\n\nGreco's artistic life was complex. His unique and distinctive style was developed from three different cultural origins; his Byzantine formation, his influence from Venetian painters and lastly his study of Michelangelo's mannerism. A sizeable portion of his work are big religious paintings for churches, for which he often used his workshop, and a group of portraits of the highest level.\n\nIt was in Spain, Toledo specifically, where Greco would fully mature his style, produce his best-known paintings and receive several major commissions. Initially influenced by Italian styles, he would eventually develop a style so unique a distinctive that modern scholars believe he does not belong to any conventional school. Despite being met with puzzlement by his contemporaries, Greco is now regarded as a precursor of both expressionism and cubism and one of the greatest artists of Western civilization."

  flavor_eth.29.t: "Crossing the Ogaden"
  flavor_eth.29.d: "The Ogaden has always been the home of pastoralists and a frontier for many kingdoms and sultanates. Despite the harsh landscape many nomads and armies have routinely passed through here in an effort to reach distant lands, and there has always been little in the way of central authority. Surrounding several of our towns as it does however, recently some of our merchants and cavalry units have made an effort to survey the area and map out the primary trails used in the Ogaden, and they have just come back to us to report their findings. Though this hasn't changed the nature of the region and it remains in the hands of pastoralists as always we consider it less of a frontier now and more of a part of our realm proper."
