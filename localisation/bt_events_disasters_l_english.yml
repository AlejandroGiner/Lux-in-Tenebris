 btpIRE.EVTDESC1:0 "It seems our growth has not gone unnoticed by the English monarch. Their representative, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, has arrived in our court demanding we travel to England to bend the knee, citing the outrageous Laudabiliter issued by their pet pope Adrian IV. We could declare the legitimacy of our independent rule in Ireland, which might bring swift and terrible war to Ireland. If we wish to avoid war, we could accept their demands for now and bide our time for a more opportune moment."           #Changed from BtP, adjusted wording

King Christian I agreed to a considerable dowry, with the islands of Orkney and Shetland, possessions of the Norwegian crown, pledged as security. The dowry was never paid and so the islands remained in the possession of Scotland.

 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.1.t:0 "The Death of Christopher III von Wittelsbach"
 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.1.d:0 "Christopher of the Wittelsbachs rose to the throne of Denmark and the Kalmar Union as a result of the deposition of Eric of Pomerania. Christopher however was merely meant to be a puppet under the Danish nobles and, while he did succeed in maintaining some personal control, the nobility in all three kingdoms ended up acquiring several privileges and policy-making powers that the monarchs had gained from since the Viking ages. The Swedish nobility in particular did not like the king, as evidenced by them nicknaming him the \"Bark King\". \n\nIn 1448, Christopher suddenly died at the age of 32, leaving a power vaccuum that resulted in the Lord High Constable of Sweden, Riksmarsk Karl Knutsson Bonde, being elected king in Sweden, and Christian of Oldenburg being elected King in Denmark, thus sparking a power struggle in the Kalmar Union that would last until 1457, when Christian of Oldenburg would finally be elected the King of Sweden."
 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.1.a:0 "We must regain the Swedish throne!"
 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.1.b:0 "We cannot afford to contest the Swedish throne..."
 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.2.t:0 "The Norwegian Throne"
 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.2.d:0 "The Swedish nobility and the privy council upon electing Karl Knutsson Bonde as King of Sweden sought to unify the Kalmar Union under a Swedish king instead of the Danes. As Christopher yet had little support in Norway, attempts were made at convincing the Norwegian nobles, their Council of the realm, to elect Karl Knutsson of Sweden as their new ruler. Their attempts would succeed at this, eventually crowning Karl Knutsson in the Nidaros Cathedral as king of Norway in November 1449. However, the Swedish aristocracy, mainly the Swedish Church and the noble families of Oxenstierna and Vasa, were very reluctant in backing a Swedish war attempt against Denmark, and so, barely a year later, Karl Knutsson stepped down from the Norwegian throne in favour of Christian von Oldenburg. Later, the Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna and the nobleman Erik Axelsson Tott rebelled against Karl Knutsson, exiling him to Danzig and elected Christian as the King of Sweden."

 BtPLegacyScandinavianFlavour.3.d:0 "With the sudden death of Christopher von Wittelsbach, Norway stands without a ruler! The Norwegian Council of the realm, Riksrådet, has several candidates to choose from: Either we can remain under the Danes and elect the new Danish king Christian of Oldenburg, unite under the new Swedish king Karl Knutsson Bonde, or go our own way and elect the current guardian of the realm of Norway, Sigurd Jonsson, a direct descendant of Haakon V."

A revolt led by Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna and the nobleman Erik Axelsson Tott gained ground, leading to the exile of Karl Knutsson Bonde to the city of Danzig. Acting as co-regents, they finally elected the Danish king Christian of Oldenburg as the new King of Sweden, reuniting the Kalmar Union once more."

 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC3:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubbornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation. The abject failure of the Reformation to take hold in Gaelic Ireland is attributed to a variety of factors, foremost amongst which may have been the fact that, contrary to most other Reformist and Protestant movement in Europe, the Church of Ireland refused to make use of the local language, instead disseminating materials in English. Combined with Ireland's disillusionment with England's foreign policy this created the perception that the Reformation was yet another attempt to conquer Ireland and break Gaelic influence. Another important factor, however, was support and training from continental Catholic allies who feared the ramifications of a religiously unified British Isles.\n\nAll the more was our surprise to learn that the Reformation had taken taken hold in [Root.GetName].

All Dearbhfhine, the male decendants of previous kings up to four generations back, are to vote in the selection of a new Tanist so that in the event of the King's death the Tanist will immediately ascend to the position, securing the succession and maintaining the uninterrupted leadership of the Kingdom."         #Was going for a historical basis, but it seems to history-book-ish, so rewriting it, but leaving the old one here   -   Tanistry is the traditional inheritance law of Ireland and most of Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between distant cousins.

 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC3:0 "A new heir is now is line to the throne of [Root.GetName], but to the consternation of all, this heir is a young woman! The role of the king is to act as steward to the kingdom and, as part of the inauguration, ritually marries the female personification of the kingdom, imbuing her and by extension the land with his fertility. As a woman cannot fulfill this role, women are traditionally not eligible to ascend to the throne. The prospect of a female ruler is thus enveloping the entire kingdom in a dread panic that upon the ascension of [Root.Heir.GetName], the kingdom will begin to wither and die. Doomsayers proclaim that first the crops, then the livestock, and finally the people will shrivel up and die as the land becomes barren and empty. The royal advisors suggest that a small sum be set aside for the girl's inheritance and that she be disinherited from royal succession."

 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC5:0 "In a most unusual and unexpected turn of events, a headstrong and capable young woman has garnered support from some of the Dearbhfhine, and is being considered by many as Righdamhna, and thus eligible for the throne, despite the fact that typically her anatomy would preclude her consideration. Her opponents warn against a woman in the position, as the king is ritually married to the kingdom and his fertility is meant to ensure the success of harvests and livestocks. Her supporters, however, dismiss this as superstition and cite ancient sources and laws asserting a woman's right of inheritance. Shall we encourage the girl's ambitions, or instead select a less controversial candidate?"

Despite outward appearances, however, many in the kingdom are fearful for the future, and doubtful of our continued prosperity. The royal court is simply waiting for the young queen to make a mistake, and word has reached us that small riots are appearing in all reaches of the kingdom as the superstitious fear that their beloved kingdom will become as barren without a symbolic husband. If the High Queen is to prove these doubters wrong, she will have to endure much in the years to come."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA6:0 "She will have to prove herself..."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME7:0 "The High Queen Has Proven Herself"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC7:0 "After 20 years on the throne, the kingdom under the High Queen has not shriveled up and died. Calves continue to be born, harvests continue to ripen, and the people have not succumbed to some miasma of hopelessness and despair. Even the staunchest traditionalist is forced to admit that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign has erased any doubt that a woman may rule in [Root.GetName]. In the future, female Tanists will likely face less resistance."

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME1:0 "The Reinheitsgebot"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC1:0 "In the duchy of Bavaria-Munich in 1487, Duke Albert IV decreed with the subordinates of the realm the Reinheitsgebot - Purity Law - of Bavarian beer. The law stated that beer produced in Bavaria may only ever contain water, barley and hops. Any diversion from this recipe would invalidate its claim to the name and would lead to its confiscation. The law also standardized the price of beer with a maximum price of a Mass, the Bavarian Liter, at one Pfennig in the winter and two Pfennig in the summer. Innkeepers were however allowed to add an additional half Pfennig per Mass to the sell price, but only if they bought a sufficient amount of 120 Mass from the producer. This law was later then expanded by William IV to include all of Bavaria upon its reunification in 1516. While the law was not the first among beer laws, it was the most famous and would be upheld throughout the history of the Duchy, up until the German Unification in 1871, upon which its application to all of Germany was one of the conditions of said treaty."

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTNAME2:0 "Top or Bottom Brewing"
 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC2:0 "Normally, most beers produced before the 19th century would be produced and brewed at room temperature, as possibilities of refrigeration were limited. If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top-and-bottom fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."

Its composition remained unknown until the 1750s when a French chemist managed to decompose the dye into an iron salt and a new acid, isolated and termed 30 years later by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele as \"Blue acid\". Prussian Blue became very important in Europe as it obsoleted the very expensive lapis lazuli previously used for blue coloring, as well as becoming the main color used in Prussian army uniforms and continued to be used for ceremonial purposes up into the 20th century."

Though occasionally emperors have been able to exercise some influence over the succession and laws in Northern Italy and there are many circles which pledge loyalty to the Empire, this politicking has become, more than anything else, a way to avoid the temporal power of the Pope, and a long string of coalitions and alliances designed to resist imperial influence have arisen, starting with the Lombard League in 1167.  Though the Empire's de-facto control over Italy was tenuous at points, it wasn't until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that imperial power was formally broken and all claims over Italy retracted by the emperor as a concession of the treaty to end the Thirty Years' War."

The results of these unions were an entirely new and unique culture and language, separate from that of either parent. This new race was called Métis by the French, meaning mixed race people."

 maj_civil_war.1.d: "Ever since the Paregreg War, the Majapahit Empire was always in constant decline. With the loss of subjects overseas, a constantly empty treasury, and increasingly powerful Muslim merchants in the north, it is unlikely that the Majapahit State will stay intact for much longer."

 maj_civil_war.2.d: "Through our nation, it is widely known that Muslim merchants are some of the most powerful people in the region, even sometimes being more powerful than our own King, and according to some sources, these powerful men may be the ones supplying separatists and rebels in our country.

 maj_civil_war.8.t: "Pretender Claims the Throne"

The city was described as being a forty day journey away from India, where clove, nutmeg, porcelains and silk were sold in abundance. Supposedly, the city was ruled by a Christian sovereign, who could amass an army of ten thousand men for war, which prompted King Manuel to find the city. A first expedition was launched in 1509, but ultimately failed, resulting in the capture of most of the soldiers at the hands of the Sultan. In 1511, the Viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, launched a second expedition to sieze Malacca. In July, following a rejected ultimatum to release all the prisoners from the 1509 expedition, the Sultan strengthened his defenses to prepare for an inevitable invasion. Over the course of two assaults, Albuquerque's men conquered the city, pillaging the households of those not allied to the Portuguese. The Sultan of Malacca tried several times to retake the city, but all attempts failed, leading to the eventual downfall of the Sultanate."

Having learnt that the neighbouring Siamese had claimed rights over Malacca, the Portuguese viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, sent three envoys to Ayutthaya in an attempt to establish friendly relations. The third of these envoys, led by Duarte de Coelho, concluded with a treaty signed between Portugal and Siam. In exchange for guns and ammunition, the Siamese guaranteed religious freedoms, and agreed to facilitate the efforts of the Portuguese in establishing local settlements and trade networks. As many as three hundred Portuguese nationals later settled down in Ayutthaya, with many traders and military experts being among them."

During this time, Si Sudachan was engaged in an adulterous relationship with a government officer known by his noble title of Phanbut Si Thep, who rose to prominence under the new title of Khun Chinnarat. In 1548, the young King Kaeofa was executed at Khok Phraya Temple, and Lady Si Sudachan declared Khun Chinnarat king, styling him King Worawongsa. The two, both being members of the deposed Uthong clan, were met with nationwide opposition from the other noble houses, who despised the immorale and brutal return of Uthong. United under the banner of the Suphannaphum clan, members of the Sukhothai, Suphannaphum, and Si Thammarat clans united against Uthong, and assassinated the usurper and his adulteress, handing over the throne to Prince Thian, who was proclaimed King Maha Chakkraphat."
