  waldensian: "Waldensian"
  waldensian_religion_desc: "Originally a reform movement within the Catholic church, the Waldensians were forced to turn anti-clerical following their excommunication and advocated for a return to vows of poverty and earlier forms of Christianity. The religion takes its name from its founder Peter Waldo, who began preaching in Lyon and surrounding areas in the 12th century. Waldensians are opposed to capital punishment and believe that laymen can also administer the sacraments. The Protestants eventually considered Waldensians as precursors to the Reformation.\n\nIn the game the Waldensian faith has been significantly cut down by repression and mostly survives in the remote mountainous regions of Piedmont and Arpitania."

  waldensian_events.1.d: "Our religion teaches the value of austerity, and displays of great wealth undoubtedly go against not only the teachings of our founder Peter Waldo, but those of Jesus Christ himself. It has not been easy to convince the clergy and nobility of our nation to abandon such pathetic attachment to wordly riches, but in this case, something even worse has happened.\n\nOne of our most well known preachers in [waldensian_province.GetAreaName] has done a great job convincing the locals of the need of simplicity and humbleness, but we have found that in his private life, he definitely does not practice what he preaches. He often entertains foreign merchants and emissaries by displaying his vast collection of antiques, organizing sophisticated banquets and boasting about the political power he enjoys in our nation.\n\nWhile his duties as a man of God have been much appreciated, it is now clear that he has overstepped his authority and become one of those people he criticizes in his sermons. Should we replace him, it would greatly anger his supporters in the province, but if we keep men like him around, our nation eventually would be known only as a hive of scum and villainy."

The good men of [waldensian_province.GetName], having treasured their newfound peace and prosperity, have set out to maintain it and have come to us with an interesting proposal: using honed tactics their ancestors passed on when it comes to defending the plateau, they claim they can greatly strengthen the defenses over the entire area, possibly even including provinces that are not mountainous.

Despite this, pilgrimages remain popular in all Christian nations including our own, and the province of [waldensian_province.GetName] has recently become a popular site for pilgrims as it was the site where a popular monk was martyred many years ago. So far we have turned a blind eye to this, but we are increasingly receiving reports that people have been disappearing in the area, apparently taken by highwaymen or even wild beasts. With the pilgrimage already being barely tolerated, we now have an excuse to finally curtail these activities, even if it may anger the pilgrims."

Yesterday the son of an important noble was publicly criticized by a priest for his extravagantly expensive clothing, and his father did not take it well: he has requested a meeting with you in order to convince you to punish the clergy responsible for the insult while voicing the nobility's desire for their status to be respected and not loathed. It is true that, as the noble says, we are all sons of God, but the clergy has pointed out that if we do not enforce what we preach, how are we any different from the Antichrist in Rome?"

They claim that our religious and political doctrines promote the weak and feeble, and our shunning of great wealth simply showcases our barbaric and uncultured nature.

Anonymously written centuries ago near Lyon, for many generations it only survived as a smuggled document to prevent it from being confiscated and burned by Papist authorities. Now that we have finally established firm Waldensian authority in [Root.GetName], it has become a tradition to periodically read passages from La Nobla Leyczon in huge gatherings. Such events are often attended by foreign dignitaries, but have been known to cause significant animosity among Papist nations, and of course in the Papacy itself.

There they would confess sins and hold service. A traveling Waldensian preacher was known as a 'barba'. The group would shelter the barba and help make arrangements to move on to the next town in secret. Even as our faith has been institutionalized, we have not abandoned this practice and the barbas continue to provide us with new converts and resources."

Nonetheless, recently, a surprising turn of events has occurred. A delegation of foreign merchants has arrived at the court, and seeking an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName], they praised the peace and stability of our realm, claiming that our officials are particularly honest in their dealings and that it has been a pleasure for them to work with us.

We have since replaced these officials but the area is now in a significantly bad shape, so something has to be done in order to allow the people of [waldensian_province.GetName] to live and work normally again."

A sizeable group of barbas operating in a foreign nation have been betrayed by the very person who was supposed to give them shelter and imprisoned by the authorities. This is not only a significant loss of valuable preachers for our cause, but also a blow to the prestige of our organization since a traitor was able to infiltrate our preacher group this easily. Either way, our missionary activities will be less effective for years to come."

Nonetheless, many people have not forgotten how the older, Papist Savoys used to persecute the innocent people of Piedmont with vile massacres and unjust exiles. As a result many have increasingly complained about the reverence the ruling family still shows towards their ancestors, with statues and naming conventions to honor the past oppressors. We have so far claimed that it is up to God to forgive them for the persecution, but popular sentiment has increasingly turned against what they claim is reverence towards followers of the Antichrist in Rome, and we must at last decide what to do."

  waldensian_events.21.d: "The beautiful city of Lyon is finally in Waldensian hands! This is the city where our founder Peter Waldo first began preaching and denouncing the sins of the Papist establishment. He was inspired by a series of events, firstly, after hearing a sermon on the life of St. Alexius, secondly, rejection of transubstantiation when it was considered a capital crime to do it, thirdly, the sudden and unexpected death of a friend during an evening meal. From this point onward he began living a true Christian life, giving his property over to his wife, while the remainder of his belongings he distributed as alms to the poor. At about this time, Waldo began to preach and teach publicly, based on his ideas of simplicity and poverty, notably that 'No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon.' Waldo condemned what he considered as papal excesses and Catholic dogmas, including purgatory and transubstantiation. He said that these dogmas were 'the harlot' from the book of Revelation.\nAs a result, the city of Lyon holds great value for our faithful, and many are demanding that we hold a celebration for such a historical moment. Others however claim such worldy undertakings would only result in us distancing ourselves further from Waldo's own teachings. What shall we do?"

Some say he escaped to Germany, others say to Italy, but while we know he was never captured, his ultimate destination remained a mystery.\nUntil now.\nA group of men has recently come forward claiming to have known where Waldo's ultimate burial place was. This has piqued great interest among our faithful, claiming that he should be given a proper burial in a church in Lyon, instead of staying in the ditch his remains were found in. Many however remain skeptical regarding the true nature of these remains, claiming there is no evidence to back up the men's claim."

Officials who went to the site of the burial, by analyzing the population census and talking to the locals, confirmed that the remains are those of a former Papist soldier, who was even guilty of persecution against our people! This is a humiliating blow against our leadership, as despite our best efforts to keep this silent the word has already spread that we have buried a Papist murderer in our most sacred cathedral."

  nestorian_religion_desc: "Nestorianism is an ancient Christian branch which states that Christ has two separate natures - one divine and one human. This is the opposite of the Monophysite position where Christ has but a single nature. The nominal head of the Nestorian Church is the Patriarch of the East. Spread by the Apostles who went east into Persia, the Church of the East spread through the Middle East and into Asia. Despite the name, Nestorianism indicates mostly adherence to the Church of the East rather than strict belief in Nestorius' own teachings. Without state support the Church gradually died out in many places, leaving behind beautiful churches and haunting graveyards.\n\nIn game Nestorians have largely been supplanted following the Islamic and Mongol invasions, with isolated pockets remaining in a few places in Asia."

For the narrow door, which would not admit a man without much stooping, the usual explanation is given, 'Strait is the gate', a truth of which the Nestorians wish to be reminded when entering the sanctuary. The prayers and the singing or chanting of the psalms are all in the ancient Syriac language, and quite unintelligible to the common people. But one of the priests has begun reading a portion of the Gospels, and giving the translation into the vulgar language spoken by the local Nestorians, and this constitutes the preaching. Some among the clergy and the locals are claiming that more of the service should be held in the local vernacular, but the highest ecclesiastical authorities claim that doing so would merely ruin the quality of our processions and expose our services to foreign interference.

In these rituals there is nothing of that idolatrous adoration of the host, so characteristic of the mass of the Romanists and the other Oriental churches that turned their backs at us so long ago.

They have convinced the rebel monk to convert to Catholicism, and has he made his way to Rome to present his case, he was recognised as "Patriarch of Mosul" by pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] in the bull Divina Disponente Clementia, and received the pallium from the pope's hands at a secret consistory in the Vatican.

  btc_nestorian_seats.1.d: "Nisibis was in times past one of the most important seats for Christianity in Mesopotamia. It was the home of the glorious School of Nisibis, founded all the way in 350 by Saint Jacob the Great: this school is sometimes referred to as the world's first university. The province was hotly contested between the Romans and Persian empires, and the school was forced to close down several times. Following the Nestorian Schism it became an important centre for the Church of the East for hundreds of years. Since then, Arabs, Byzantines, Turks have ruled over the city which has greatly diminished in importance. In our holy revival of the glorious Church, it is time to once again give Nisibis the importance it deserves."
  btc_nestorian_seats.2.d: "Ctesiphon was once one of the largest cities in the world. Serving as a major trade hub and as the capital for several Persian empires as well as an important seat for the Church of the East, it entered a deep period of decline following the Muslim conquests in the 7th century. With its wealth plundered and its materials used to construct a new city, Baghdad, the only thing remaining to this day of the once glorious city are the still impressive ruins of the great palace, Taq Kasra. Now that the area is once again under firm Christian grasp, and the faithful have returned to live where their ancestors once did, the time has come to re-establish the seat of Ctesiphon to include the area in and around Baghdad."
  btc_nestorian_seats.3.d: "Arbela. A key city in what was thousands of years ago the glorious Assyrian Empire. And even after the fall of that empire, it would remain the de facto capital of Assyrian culture and language for many years to come still, as well as one of the most important centers for the Church of the East. Much has changed since then. Repeated raids by Turks and Mongols have crushed the city again and again, and it remains one of the most tragic reminders of martyrdom for eastern Christianity. Despite bishop Mar Yahballaha's best efforts to avert the impending doom, the citadel was at last taken after a siege by Ilkhanate troops and Kurdish tribesmen on 1 July 1310, and all the defenders were massacred, including many of the Assyrian inhabitants of the lower town. The nail that sealed the coffin was then given by Tamerlane's sack of the city in 1397. But finally the city is once again in the hands of the Church, and as Assyrians flock to their former capital, we can at last re-establish this historic Seat, and make sure not to lose it again."
  btc_nestorian_seats.4.d: "The ancient city of Beth Lapat served as an important place of refugee for adherents of the Church of the East, fleeing Byzantine persecution. It became a great centre of learning in the 6th century, where philosophic and scientific texts from the Greeks and Assyrians were stored alongside texts from Indians and Chinese scholars. The university as well as local Seat declined under Muslim rule, and now the city is nothing more than yet another ghost town. However, we have not forgotten the great achievements that once took place here, and it is time to restore this province to its former glory and make sure the towns in the region once again serve the needs of the Church of the East."

Today however marks a significant shift in the history of this city and the region surrounding it, as by being able to assert our authority over these lands, and reconstitute the Seat that has for so long been vacant, we have demonstrated to the people of Herat not only the capabilities of our leadership, but also the strength of our faith. The Church of the East shall watch over them now."

Once one of the world's greatest cities, home to communities of Christians but also Manichaeans, Zoroastrians, Buddhists and others, it was destroyed by the Mongol armies, with its entire population killed. Though rebuilt after this catastrophe, the city never regained its full former prosperity. That, it seems, is a task that God has commanded us to carry out. Merv shall once again shine brightly among the cities on the Silk Road, it once again shall have a thriving merchant community, and it shall once again be an important Seat for the Church of the East. The few remaining local Christians of Merv are already helping us convince the locals of our good intentions, and under our leadership, the city shall no longer suffer a similar fate. None of our cities shall."

Some may say, too much has changed to turn back the clock. Yet we are going to prove them wrong, because re-establishing the Seat of Samarkand is but the beginning. Just as others have built on top of our foundations, so shall we build on top of theirs, and we shall make Samarkand shine with innovation, with newfound glory.

Our conquest of this region and our interaction with the locals have well showed us that for how ancient and enduring the places and people here are, changes tends to come extremely rapidly to the Caucasus. Oftentimes accompanied by the fury of thousands of horsemen from the northern plains. But if there is anything our Church has taught us, it is the importance of our legacy. Our entire mission has revolved around restoring what conquerors and warlords destroyed for their own personal gain, what heathens thought was too pure to legitimize. And so, we shall do the asme thing here. Murak shall rise again, its leading position as a Seat for our Church in the region will once again become a reality, and so will its wealth and prosperity."
  btc_nestorian_seats.9.d: "The Christians of the Malabar Coast demonstrate, well above and beyond any building or ruin we have found, the strength and importance of the communion in our faith. Separated by continents, languages, cultures, and yet they have never wavered in their creed. Tormented and oppressed for generations by the people who lived next to them, who treated them as hostile invaders, despite them being native to the land, them being the brothers and sisters of the same people who persecuted them. And yet they've barely moved an inch. Even in these sinister times, with sea-faring missionaries and explorers from the West coming to these shores, they have never abandoned the one true Church. And in these new times, with adherents from the Church of the East interacting on a much greater level than before, that lesson is more important to us than anything else. More than the re-establishment of the Seat of Angamaly. More than the prosperity set to be enjoyed by the people of the Malabar for generations to come. As long as there is a communion, we will endure."
  btc_nestorian_seats.10.d: "A most extraordinary discovery was made in the Chinese province of Xi'an. A stele, buried underneath the earth for centuries, confirms what many of us already knew about missionary activity to the Far East in times past. This limestone block, with text in both Syriac and Chinese, details the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Church of the East had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen. It is not too surprising to find the stele here of all places, as this section of China is the only one where a few Christians have endured in the face of sustained persecution by this arrogant, self-described 'Celestial Empire'. It is of no importance though. The resilence of the people who have suffered in Xi'an solely because of their faith serves as an example to us on what road to take. These Christian settlements mentioned in the Stele will soon become a reality once again, and no arrogant, destructive empire is going to prevent that from happening. Re-establishing the Seat of Xi'an is but the first step."

It is therefore all the more remarkable that as of late we have found great success in encouraging the Yazidis to take a more active part in our society, and in doing so, we are finding out much more about their mysterious society and rituals. What is more important however, is that the benefits of this cooperation are already starting to become apparent."

Many have now abandoned their once secluded mountain life and have begun more actively participating in the affairs of the nation. We are learning from them the values of a tightly disciplined, yet caste-less society, which is greatly fascinating our scholars, and the works of our finest philosophers are being integrated into their own religious customs.

Baha'u'llah taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Bab and Baha'u'llah. As the Baha'is became more numerous in our society, they have now began to regard the great scholar Confucius as one such prophet, enthusiastically claiming that he followed the same creed of world peace and stability that they also seek to establish.

This gives us an unprecedented understanding of the work of a brilliant tradition that, much like Confucianism, sought to unite the people under the banner of stability.

  dg_zoroastrian.026.d:1 "Our late ruler has left considerable property to the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - but with a caveat that it must be spent \"for the soul\".\n\nZoroastrianism emphasised not only charity, but also a responsibility for the souls of the dead.  When a Zoroastrian died, they usually left one part of their property to be inherited normally (\"with right of possession\"), one part in trusteeship, and a third part \"for the preservation of the soul\"."
  dg_zoroastrian.026.d_soul:1 "\nThis last part is the issue at hand: if had been worded \"for religious services for the soul\", it would have been limited to rites and ceremonies only.  Since it is simply worded \"for the soul\", then it can be used any way that is beneficial to the soul - for example, to build temples to Ahura Mazda, give alms to the poor, establish a charitable foundation (\"Ruwanagan\"), or even build roads and bridges for the people - in effect giving the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] considerable leeway on how to spend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] inheritance."
  dg_zoroastrian.026.d_religious:1 "\nThis last part is the issue at hand: because it is worded \"for religious services for the soul\", it can only be used to pay for rites and ceremonies, whereas if it had been worded simply \"for the soul,\", the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would have had more choice in how to spend the money.

As the holders of the law, they resolved disputes between members of community based on moral judgements.  The aggrieved parties would congregate in a temple before the 'court fire' (Atash Dadgah) which stood in for Asha, the law of God.  There the Dastur would dispense justice in common law cases.  However, this justice was superceded by royal edicts, so petitioners could appeal the ruling at the royal court.  Doing so had the potential to offend, however."

The sacrifice of animals to Ahura Mazda was not unheard of, especially a cow or lamb given in thanks for good luck.  There was scriptural support for it in the Avestas and it was part of Persian culture, so ritual sacrifices persisted...and caused controversy.  Many Zoroastrians felt that it belonged more to the pagan heritage of Persia than to the simple, monotheistic faith of individual responsibility that Zoroaster had created - especially when it was combined with the ritualistic drinking of Houma extract.  Was this Daeva-yasna - the worship of false gods that Zoroaster had warned them against?  Or was it Zoroastrian law?  Zoroaster had spoken out against animal sacrifice, but it was the cruelty he was opposed to, not the sacrifice itself.

The opposite, then, was to strengthen his opponent and invite evil into the world.

This particular priest has been particularly transparent about his greed, and those he has coerced into payments include high-ranking officials and their families.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, the forgiveness of sins was a ritual in which the penitent spent seven to nine days performing a ritual without touching water or fire.  The final step was corporal punishment, but it could be offset by paying a fine commensurate to the sin and to one's station, which meant that a provincial lord was required to pay far more than a sharecropper.
