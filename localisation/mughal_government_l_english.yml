 great_mongol_state_reform_saharan_group_assimilated_desc:0 "Fur people are a relatively small group consisting of mostly semi-nomadic cattle herd families and small agricultural towns. Being a fairly simple society governed by village elders and known for their Muslim piety, we can learn from them how to better administer our lands at a local level."

 great_mongol_state_reform_aramaic_group_assimilated_desc:0 "The Assyrian people have inhabitated the Middle East for centuries. Dating their civilization to the ancient Kingdom of Assyria, they converted to Christianity and mantained extensive contact with Roman and Byzantine authorities for generations. Though they eventually fell to the Muslim conquests, the Assyrians have retained a high degree of proficiency in government and diplomacy and are still willing to use their skill and contacts to benefit their people, and now us."

 great_mongol_state_reform_hayer_assimilated_desc:0 "At the crossroads between the East and the West, the Armenians have always held close ties with Europe despite also having their own political and cultural customs. This versatility was highlighted during the Crusades, when in order to defend themselves the various Armenian kingdoms quickly adopted western tactics and weapons, mixing them with their local traditions. Such professional versatility is what we need for our armies."

 great_mongol_state_reform_adyghe_assimilated_desc:0 "The Circassians are the original inhabitants of the Northwest Caucasus, and like many other people in the region they've often had to deal with foreign invaders. The Circassian horsemen and raiders acquired fame for being able to inflict considerable casualties on much more technologically advanced armies such as those of Russia or the Ottoman Empire. Their resilence is the stuff of legends, and now, it is also part of our armies."

 great_mongol_state_reform_alanic_assimilated_desc:0 "Ossetians make the central Caucasus their home. Throughout history, they have become infamous for their efficient raiding against enemies from as close as Caucasian neighbors to as far away as the Roman Empire. Unethical as it may be, we cannot let the opportunity of taking advantage of this pass by."

Their hardy mountaineers have been known to successfully defeat much larger and more professional armies. Their experience in combat is unmatched in the Caucasus, and will be of great use to our military."

 great_mongol_state_reform_dutch_group_assimilated_desc:0 "The Netherlands underwent a significant period of political turmoil, with foreign influence being constantly countered by a strong desire for independence. The low countries wasted no time in asserting their wealth and power, and their traders and explorers are renowed in the whole world for their expertise. Now, we can finally put their services to good use."
