As Danish generals gave the order, soldiers entered the Hanseatic Kontor, grabbed their treasury and slaughtered the burghers within. They entered the Rathaus, and as the local noblemen plead for mercy, few were spared. The city was thoroughly looted and the population was almost cut in half. With all the atrocities committed, there is no doubt that the city will take decades, perhaps even centuries, to recover. That is, if it ever will. One thing is for certain however: Once the other Hanseatic cities will hear of this onslaught, they'll harbor great hatred, but also fear, of us and our military."

 bt_sacking_events.2.t:0 "The Sack of [12.GetName]"
 bt_sacking_events.2.d:0 "As the Swedish army entered [12.GetName], panic spread across the streets as the soldiers chased them down into their buildings. The Swedish generals gave the order that no Dane should be spared. Horrible atrocities were committed by the Swedish army as they looted the Copenhagen castle and depleted the Danish treasury. Whatever remains of the Danish population will certainly harbor great hatred towards us, but without a position of strength, there is little they can do but to submit to our rule. Copenhagen itself, however, will not recover for many decades."
 bt_sacking_events.2.a:0 "That shows them. Danskjävlar!"

Mentioned specifically as early as the year 98 by the Roman historian Tacitus,  'Baltic Amber', as it is known, is so particularly abundant in the area that it washes up on the shoreline all on its own. The semi-precious stone is so abundant that despite being collected since distant antiquity, production continued to increase to the point that by the 18th century, it is believe that 95% of all finished amber produced worldwide originated from this region."
 bt_super_cows:0 "Friesian Cattle"
 desc_bt_super_cows:0 "The people of the small grassy islands of northwestern Europe were long known for their pastoral expertise, raising large and productive white dairy cattle since antiquity.

The result was a typically black and white piebald animal which proved extremely productive, producing a large share of Europe's beef, milk, & cheese."
 bt_brauhaus_der_hansa:0 "Brewery of the Hansa"
 desc_bt_brauhaus_der_hansa:0 "The northern coast of Germany came to be know for its beer production, and none more so than Hamburg. Fondly called the 'Hansa's Brewery', the city's brewers were some of the first to use hops, rather than fruit, in the brewing process, and the resulting drink was so popular that it earned the city its nickname. From humble beginning in the 1200s with a few small operations, the city would grow to contain 500 breweries by the middle of the 16th century, supplying much of northern Europe with the finest beer."
 bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Granary of the North"
 desc_bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Grain is not particularly abundant around the Baltic Sea. Temperatures are generally too cold and the ground too sandy or rocky to sustain more than modest crops of rye in many places, so any fertile soil producing reliably large yields of grain becomes particularly important. The countryside around Danzig is unusually fertile, and its position near the mouth of the Vistula positions it ideal to import grain from further upstream, as well. This combination slowly transformed Danzig into a major grain port in the late Middle Ages, and eventually it came to be known as 'der Kornhaus der Hansa' (the granary of the Hanseatic League). A large share of Northern Europe's staple grain was either grown here, or at least passed through."
 bt_wines_of_bordeaux:0 "Claret of Bordeaux"
 desc_bt_wines_of_bordeaux:0 "Winemaking was first introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, but it wasn't until the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1089 that wine production began in earnest. Following the marriage, the Aquitaine region suddenly found itself within the sprawling Angevin Empire, which had a strong taste for quality wine but little other land suitable for intensive viticulture. As a result, the industry was heavily developed and by the mid 1100s Bordeaux was already exporting vast quantities of wine, most commonly a rosé known as 'claret', to northwestern Europe."
 bt_basque_whaling:0 "Basque Whaling"
 desc_bt_basque_whaling:0 "The Basque were the first in the world to hunt whales commercially, and the most successful by far until the 18th century. The burgeoning industry was centered primarily along the Basque coast, especially around San Sebastián, which was first granted whaling rights in 1150. By the 15th century there were about 50 'land factories' all along the Atlantic coast, where Basque sailors rented land to flense and butcher their catch."
 bt_la_beauce:0 "La Beauce"
 desc_bt_la_beauce:0 "The Beauce is a large natural region in northern France noted for its particularly fertile soil and abundant harvests. The flat, fertile region, quite possibly the most productive in all of Europe, is responsible for a large share of France's grain production, and its historical center in Chartres is a major grain exporter."
 bt_mercury_of_almaden:0 "Mines of Almadén"
 desc_bt_mercury_of_almaden:0 "Almadén is home to the world's largest reserves of cinnabar and mercury. First mined by the Romans, the seemingly inexhaustible supply would later become of vital importance as mercury was discovered to be vital in a new process of extracting pure gold or silver from raw ore."
 curonian_strait_toll:0 "Curonian Strait Toll"
 desc_curonian_strait_toll:0 "The Curonian Lagoon is separated from the rest of the Baltic Sea by a narrow strip of land called the Curonian Spit, creating a natural chokepoint at the only exit for the many cities and towns along the lagoon. Just some couple hundred meters wide, gaining control of this natural chokepoint will ensure our continued relevance in regional trade."

 desc_bt_iberian_crowns:0 "Over the course of the late Middle Ages and in the wake of the Reconquista, the Crown of Aragon evolved into a composite monarchy, essentially multiple different de-facto independent states falling under the same ruler. The great autonomy and minimal forced integration proved inoffensive to most and sytem was stable enough that Aragon, a comparably poor and rural microstate, was able to rule over a union of a nearly a dozen other kingdoms."
 livonian_confederation: "Livonian Diet"
 desc_livonian_confederation: "The bishoprics of the Livonian Confederation were feudal principalities of Terra Mariana, and together with the Livonian Order, formed the Livonian Confederation.
