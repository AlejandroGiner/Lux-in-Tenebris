 postcolonial_idea1_desc:0 "We will not, we will not be slaves. We will not, we will not carry the yoke any longer. Those who wished to oppress us are gone and as long as we remember the strength and willpower that gave us freedom, we shall never falter in front of any crisis."
 postcolonial_idea2:0 "Resources takeover"
 postcolonial_idea2_desc:0 "Our great nation was dotted with plantations, mines, harbors and other such means for our former overlords of exploiting our labor force only for the profit to be sent back to their own land. No more! Whatever we produce now will remain firmly in our hands!"
 postcolonial_idea3:0 "Native assimilation"
 postcolonial_idea3_desc:0 "Our roots may come from faraway lands, yet we've had to share our destiny with the original inhabitants of our nations. Some of them supported us, many of them opposed us, but regardless it is of utmost importance that we integrate them into our society and labor force."
 postcolonial_idea4:0 "New world urbanization"
 postcolonial_idea4_desc:0 "As our nation becomes stronger and more secure in its holding of the lands, we have started building great cities and many towns to house an ever increasing number of patriots, workers and soldiers."
 postcolonial_idea5:0 "Final frontier"
 postcolonial_idea5_desc:0 "Whatever lands still remain in this region for us to settle, we must ensure to do so at once. Our colonists are highly experienced and will undoubtedly make moving to even remote locations an attractive proposal to our ever growing number of subjects."
 postcolonial_idea6:0 "Market domination"
 postcolonial_idea6_desc:0 "Our overlords held control over global trade thanks to their holdings in former colonial regions such as ours. Now it is time to take the lead and push our own influence on the worldwide market."
 postcolonial_idea7:0 "To the last man!"

 gunpowder_empire_mug:0 "Mughal Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_mug_desc:0 "The Mughal Sultan Babur had employed Ottoman expert Ustad Ali Quli, who showed Babur the standard Ottoman formation—artillery and firearm-equipped infantry protected by wagons in the center, and mounted archers on both wings. Babur used this formation at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Afghan and Rajput forces loyal to the Delhi sultanate, though superior in numbers but without the gunpowder weapons, were soundly defeated.\n\nThe decisive victory of the Timurid forces is one reason opponents rarely met Mughal princes in pitched battle over the course of the empire's history. The reign of Akbar The Great, Shah Jahan and the Islamic Aurangzeb, represented the height of gunpowder use in Mughal history."
 
 gunpowder_empire_per:0 "Persian Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_per_desc:0 "Within two years of the disastrous defeat at Chaldiran, the Persian Shah Ismail had a corps of musketeers (tofangchi) numbering 8,000, and by 1521, possibly 20,000. After Abbas the Great reformed the army (around 1598), the Safavid forces had an artillery corps of 500 cannons as well as 12,000 musketeers.\n\nThe Safavids first put their gunpowder arms to good use against the Uzbeks, who had invaded eastern Persia during the civil war that followed the death of Ismail I. Their use would continue and thanks to these weapons, the Ottomans would no longer manage to secure another decisive victory against the Persians as they had at Chaldiran."
 
 gunpowder_empire_tur:0 "Ottoman Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_tur_desc:0 "By the 15th century, use of gunpowder weapons propelled the Ottoman army as one of the strongest in the world. Their siege engines proved their worth in the successful siege of Salonica in 1430 and of Constantinople in 1453. The Janissaries had been an infantry bodyguard using bows and arrows. During the rule of Sultan Mehmed II they were drilled with firearms and became perhaps the first standing infantry force equipped with firearms in the world.\n\nThe combination of artillery and Janissary firepower proved decisive at Varna in 1444 against a force of Crusaders, Baskent in 1473 against the Aq Qoyunlu, and Mohacs in 1526 against Hungary. But the battle which convinced the Safavids and the Mughals of the efficacy of gunpowder was Chaldiran in 1514, which led to the sack of the Safavid capital of Tabriz."

 PRG_idea6:0 "The Great Guerilla"
 PRG_idea6_desc:0 "During the Paraguayan War, despite the power of the Paraguayan Army, overwhelming enemy numbers forced the defenders to resort to a bloody and ultimately futile guerrilla warfare.

 CUB_idea3:0 "Bahías"
 CUB_idea3_desc:0 "If there is one thing Cuba doesn't need more of, it's coasts. We have many harbors and bays that only await proper development to be turned into functional docks. Doing so will greatly increase the capacity of our fleet."
 CUB_idea4:0 "Seeking Guarantees"
 CUB_idea4_desc:0 "Even if our colonial overlords may be gone, many still wish to add Cuba to their possessions: we must use our diplomatic skills to convince them to treat us as allies rather than subjects, until we can find other ways to deal with them."
 CUB_idea5:0 "Cuban Fleet"
 CUB_idea5_desc:0 "Our nation is vulnerable to enemy landings from all sides, not to mention the continuous pirate activity in the Caribbean. It is important to ensure our fleet is more than ready to take on any adversary. Who knows, perhaps we can also make good money out of this..."
 CUB_idea6:0 "Sugar and Tobacco"
 CUB_idea6_desc:0 "The Tobacco and Sugar plantations in Cuba generated a tremendous amounth of wealth, the latter becoming the most important in the world in the 19th century.

 CUB_idea7:0 "A Nation for Everyone"

 TNV_idea2:0 "The Three Hills"
 TNV_idea2_desc:0 "Tarnovo is situated on three hills, Tsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Sveta Gora, rising amidst the meanders of the Yantra. These hills were the main centers of kings and boyars during the Bulgarian Empire, and Sveta Gora (Holy Mountain) hill remains an important spiritual and literary center. Just as the hill's fortifications have protected us in the past, they shall do so again."
 TNV_idea3:0 "Centers of Learning"
 TNV_idea3_desc:0 "Prior to the Turkish invasions, Tarnovo was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School, painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School, and to literature. It is important to restore these great centers of learning to their former glory if we don't want to be left behind."
 TNV_idea4:0 "Banks of the Yantra"
 TNV_idea4_desc:0 "The catchment area in the Balkan Range is afforested mainly with deciduous forests, and the Yantra catchment area is well wooded and grassed in its pre-mountainous section. Although prone to flooding, the waters of the Yantra provide us with much needed water for drinking and irrigation."
 TNV_idea5:0 "Columns of History"
 TNV_idea5_desc:0 "Some of the Bulgarian Empire's most significant historical records are stored in the Holy Forty Martyrs church in Tarnovo, including Omurtag's Column, Asen's Column and the Border Column from Rodosto from the rule of Khan Krum. These columns were placed in the church by Ivan Asen II as a tribute to his mighty ancestors."
 TNV_idea6:0 "Indomitable Will"
 TNV_idea6_desc:0 "Tarnovo remained the centre of resistance against the Ottoman empire long after the fall of Bulgaria, with several uprisings beginning from the city itself, particularly those of 1598, 1686 and - lastly - 1876. Even as the Ottomans continued to oppress Bulgaria, this only hardened the spirits of the patriots wishing to see the nation reborn anew. We must ensure to never again fall under the control of such tyrants."
 TNV_idea7:0 "Re-establish the Empire"
 TNV_idea7_desc:0 "As the seat of the Imperial capital it is up to us to take the lead in re-uniting the lands of Bulgaria and forming an Empire that will, once again, give our people the security and prosperity we deserve.

 BDN_idea1_desc:0 "Ever since the days of the Romans Vidin has been an important stronghold to protect imperial borders, and under the Empire of Bulgaria this was no exception, as the city was a bishop seat and capital of a large province, and its despots were influential figures in the Empire and were on several occasions chosen for Emperors."
 BDN_idea2:0 "Baba Vida"
 BDN_idea2_desc:0 "Vidin's main landmark, the Baba Vida fortress, was built in the period from the 10th to the 14th century, and served as the city's main defensive installation during the course of the Middle Ages and acted as the most important fortress of northwestern Bulgaria."
 BDN_idea3:0 "Defend against Serbia"
 BDN_idea3_desc:0 "Many times throughout history the Serbian kings to the west have desired to add Vidin and the surrounding areas to their possessions: even today we can never know when they will strike again. It is important to have a mobile army capable of intercepting them before they lay siege to the city once again."
 BDN_idea4:0 "Echoes of Freedom"
 BDN_idea4_desc:0 "Even after the Ottomans captured Vidin in 1388 and forced the then ruler Sratsimir to become their vassal, the Bulgarians soon rose up in revolt and joined the fight against the Ottomans at the Battle of Nicopolis. Though it ended in disaster, this shows us that in order to win the path towards freedom we need to use subterfuge, and allow us to act against the Turks even if nominally vassals."
 BDN_idea5:0 "Buffer Zone"
 BDN_idea5_desc:0 "Between the 15th and 18th centuries Vidin acted as a buffer zone in the centuries-long wars between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. Repeated punitive expeditions by the Austrians and brutal crackdowns by the Ottomans depopulated the city at several times, yet, we were always able to rise up again from the ashes. No matter the enemy, we shall never waver in our resolve."
 BDN_idea6:0 "Martyrs on the Altar"
 BDN_idea6_desc:0 "In 1806, during the rule of former Janissary Osman Pazvantoglu, he captured several hundred laymen and priests from Vidin and the surrounding areas, and imprisoned the priests and Bishop Kalinik in the Church of St. Peter, and later slaughtered them before the altar. The martyrdom of the holy men reminds us to never waver in our faith and determination to maintain independence."
 BDN_idea7:0 "The Defense of Vidin"
 BDN_idea7_desc:0 "During the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885, repeated attempts to conquer Vidin by the Kingdom of Serbia failed, and its successful defense of the city, organized by Atanas Uzunov, allowed the Bulgarian army to go on the offensive and win the war decisively in Bulgaria's favor."

 DRJ_idea1:0 "Coastal Principality"
 DRJ_idea1_desc:0 "The weakness of the central government in the Bulgarian kingdom in the 14th century led to the loss of many territories, and some local feudal lords practically severed their subordinate relations with the king. In the middle of the century, this also happened with Dobruja, which the Bulgarian boyar Balik , with the help of his brothers Theodor and Dobrotitsa, turned into an independent feudal principality with Karvuna as its capital. Knowing that destiny is in our hands rather than that of distant overlords gives our people newfound security."
 DRJ_idea2:0 "Breadbasket of Eastern Bulgaria"
 DRJ_idea2_desc:0 "As a traditional breadbasket, Dobruja supplied wheat to Constantinople mostly via the major ports of Varna and Kaliakra frequented by the Genoese and Venetian fleets. This state of affairs not only ensures we always have enough supplies for our armies, but also increases our trade efficiency."
 DRJ_idea3:0 "Monetary Independence"
 DRJ_idea3_desc:0 "As chaos grippled the Empire of Bulgaria, the breakaway principality of Dobruja sought to mint its own coins in order to achieve full independence and stabilize the economy. In these troubled times this allows us to better manage our banks and provinces."
 DRJ_idea4:0 "Sail the Black Sea"
 DRJ_idea4_desc:0 "Unlike the other Bulgarian principalities we have the benefit of having a coast, from which we can launch a powerful fleet to serve our interests in the region. Be it protecting trade or defending against hostile invaders navy should be one of our top priorities."
 DRJ_idea5:0 "Hoist the Black Flag"

 DRJ_idea6:0 "Seaside Strongholds"
 DRJ_idea6_desc:0 "The coastal strongholds of Dobruja, notably the Kaliakra Fortress offer us much needed protection from enemy raids. As the Turks in the region grow more hostile it is of utmost importance that we keep these strongholds manned and maintained, lest our enemy catches us unprepared."
 DRJ_idea7:0 "Allies Overseas"
 DRJ_idea7_desc:0 "Our conflicted relations with the Genoese and Byzantines do allow us to find allies in unlikely places: the Republic of Venice is known for having hostile relations with both of those powers, so it would be in our best interest to seek an alliance with them."

Even though this region was hotly contested between Byzantines, Serbs and Bulgarians the despotate managed to retain independence until being forced into vassalage by the Ottomans following the Battle of Maritsa in 1371."
 VBZ_idea2:0 "Multi-ethnic Society"
 VBZ_idea2_desc:0 "Macedonia has seen many different peoples settle in the area, from Greeks to Illyrians, from Bulgarians to Serbs. Even though the area has a significant Bulgarian majority today it is still important that we maintain harmony between rulers and subjects, irrespective of their country of origin."
 VBZ_idea3:0 "Rugged Landscape"
 VBZ_idea3_desc:0 "Macedonia is a rugged landscape with several mountains and hills, all of which contribute to warfare in this area being quite difficult. Fortunately, this also means that our troops have had enough experience in mastering such landscapes and do not suffer as much attrition from it."
 VBZ_idea4:0 "Coin Minting in Macedonia"
 VBZ_idea4_desc:0 "As independent rulers of Velbazhd, the Dragas brothers had their own government and minted coins according to the Nemanjic style. These actions allowed the despotate to achieve not just stability but also legitimacy by using tried and trued methods of past dynasties."
 VBZ_idea5:0 "Pacifying our Borders"
 VBZ_idea5_desc:0 "As our hostile neighbors hold lands in southern and western Macedonia, as well as Serbia and Bulgaria, it is in our best interest to claim these lands for ourselves in order to secure our border and prevent the Turks from ever thinking they can treat us as a mere vassal ever again."
 VBZ_idea6:0 "Soldiers of all Kinds"
 VBZ_idea6_desc:0 "Being a hotly contested area between several empires, there are many disgruntled soldiers who used to work in their armies who now perform their services as mercenaries. It would be in our best interest to enlist these experienced men for our cause."
 VBZ_idea7:0 "Great Descendants"
 VBZ_idea7_desc:0 "Although the Dragas family wisely ruled the Despotate of Velbazhd, their dynasty had even greater successors, and those included Constantine XI, the last Byzantine Emperor, and Ivan the Terrible of Russia. These relatives in ruling families of great European powers will undoubtedly be important to us."

 SZK_idea2:0 "Warrior Castes"
 SZK_idea2_desc:0 "Our society is split into three groups. The commoners (or pixidarii) hold small parcels of land and fight as foot soldiers. The wealthier primipili act as mounted warriors. Finally, the high-ranking primores represent the highest hierarchy in Székely society."
 SZK_idea3:0 "Széks"
 SZK_idea3_desc:0 "The Székely administrative units were known as széks (or seats) from the middle of the 14th century. Each seat was headed by two elected officials, the lieutenant (maior exercitus) and the seat judge (iudex terrestris). Theoretically, lieutenants were responsible for the military affairs and seat judges administered justice, but lieutenants also heard legal disputes. Both seat judges and lieutenants heard disputes together with twelve jurors."
 SZK_idea4:0 "Resisting Centralization"
 SZK_idea4_desc:0 "Stephen Báthory, Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys, made several attempts to reduce the autonomy of the seats in the early 1490s, accusing many primores of high treason. He confiscated their estates and forced Székely heiresses to marry his retainers. Fortunately, through perseverance and persuasion, we have convinced the King of Hungary to replace this troublesome official. This precedent well shows us that the path to lasting prosperity lies in the pen as much as it does in the sword."
 SZK_idea5:0 "Push Back the Turks"
 SZK_idea5_desc:0 "The Ottoman armies push deeper and deeper into Carpathia and threaten to put an end to our autonomy after their victories against the Hungarian Army. We must be opportunistic and choose our allies wisely during these troubling times. Michael the Brave of Romania would be a powerful ally to have..."
 SZK_idea6:0 "Trouble in Transylvania"
 SZK_idea6_desc:0 "Repeated attempts by the Habsburg monarchy to incorporate Transylvania have not gone unnoticed among the Székelys and many are anxious to defend our homeland against these arrogant conquerors. As we can no longer count on the protection of the old Kingdom of Hungary it is important to assert our control over the entirety of Carpathia in order to defend the frontier from the enemy rather than our doorstep."
 SZK_idea7:0 "Remembering the Siculicidium"
 SZK_idea7_desc:0 "The accursed Habsburg armies treacherously slaughtered over 400 of our brothers and sisters at Csík-Madéfalva, where the Székely leaders were supposed to meet in a council. We must not forget this defeat and never allow our will to be broken."

 KYL_idea5:0 "Volkskirche"
 KYL_idea5_desc:0 "Under the influence of Johannes Honterus, the great majority of the Transylvanian Saxons embraced the new creed of Martin Luther during the Protestant Reformation. One of the consequences of the Reformation was the emergence of an almost perfect equivalence, in the Transylvanian context, of the terms Lutheran and Saxon, with the Lutheran Church in Transylvania being de facto a 'Volkskirche', i.e. the 'national church' of the Transylvanian Saxons."

 KUS_idea2:0 "All the King's Men"

 VDN_idea2:0 "Bishophric of Verdun"
 VDN_idea2_desc:0 "At the beginning of the 4th century, Verdun was evangelized by Saint Sanctin who had the first church dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul built on Mount St. Vanne.

This proud bishophric is still going strong to this day thanks to our piety and efficient management."
 VDN_idea3:0 "Flowering Trade"
 VDN_idea3_desc:0 "Verdun was always a prosperous city which traded in metals, wines, fabrics, cereals and spices with the countries in the north.

 VDN_idea4:0 "Center of Arts"
 VDN_idea4_desc:0 "During the Middle Ages Verdun built a reputation as a city of great importance to the arts, thanks to its goldsmithing and its production of illuminated manuscripts and Vitreous enamel. One of our most celebrated artists was Nicholas of Verdun, one of the most famous goldsmiths and enamelists of the Middle Ages. He was a major figure in Romanesque art, and the leading figure of Mosan art in his day, creating shrines, figurines and candlesticks decorated with precious stones and traveling around Europe to fulfill major commissions. His legacy and that of the other artists ensures that our city is one of major prestige thanks to attracting like-minded individuals."
 VDN_idea5:0 "The Free City of Verdun"
 VDN_idea5_desc:0 "Occupied by the war, the kings of France no longer take care of guarding our city, leaving the Empire to restore its authority there. In 1374, Verdun thus obtained the title of free city of Empire, placed under the direct supervision of the emperor. This newfound sense of security allowed us to develop our institutions and city."
 VDN_idea6:0 "French Influence"
 VDN_idea6_desc:0 "Even if the city remains a land of Empire and the bishop a Prince of Empire, the city is increasingly coming under French influence, because of the language, the origin of the bishops and religious orders, the style of architecture and the economy (use of currencies and commercial relations). In addition, the Holy Roman Empire's weak central leadership means a lack of protection for the territory of the cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun against looters. Perhaps our heart truly lies with France in the end, but separating the realms of France and Germany means it is in our best interests to maintain positive relations with both."
 VDN_idea7:0 "Fortify the City"
 VDN_idea7_desc:0 "From 1624 to 1636, a large bastioned citadel was constructed on the site of the Abbey of Saint Vanne. In 1670, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban visited Verdun and drew up an ambitious scheme to fortify the whole city. It is important that we carry out these schemes in order to make sure our city will be able to resist any siege until reinforcements arrive."

Today we are a proud republic, but any kind of government will work well in the hands of our capable administrators."
 MTZ_idea2:0 "Within the Empire"
 MTZ_idea2_desc:0 "The status of Free City in the empire grants us significant priviledges, and being situated at the crossroads between France and Germany brings important diplomatic opportunities. Because we have long been considered a buffer area, it is here that Emperor Charles IV in 1354 and 1356 held diets, promulgating the Golden Bull decree of 1356 , fixing important constitutional aspects of the Holy Roman Empire. Even if many might seem our priviledges as unfair advantages, it is important to keep working within the Empire for our own goals."

 MTZ_idea5_desc:0 "Even during the times of the Carolingian Renaissance Metz was already an important centre of culture where the illumination of Carolingian manuscripts took place, producing some monuments of Carolingian book illumination such as the Drogo Sacramentary. Even today many writers and thinkers flock to Metz for a variety of reasons. During the Reformation, French Renaissance writer François Rabelais came in Metz to escape the condemnation for heresy by the University of Paris.

 TUL_idea6:0 "Stone Ramparts"

Their adherents established a Gymnasium, headed by Johannes Sturm, made into a University in the following century. Strasbourg thus became a centre of humanist scholarship and early book-printing in the Holy Roman Empire, and its intellectual and political influence contributed much to the establishment of Protestantism as an accepted denomination in the southwest of Germany. It was here  Johannes Gutenberg created the first European moveable type printing press."

 PER_idea1_desc:0 "The Safavid Dynasty has its origins in the the 13th century, which saw the foundation of the Safavid Order in Azerbaijan. Originally a Sunni Sufi order, over the years and through its growing association with a number of the region’s Turkish tribes, later organized into military troops known as the Qizilbash, the Order embraced Twelver Shi'ism and developed a more radical, messianic discourse and undertook a pro-active military strategy. The founder of the dynasty, Ismail I, was the last in the line of hereditary Grand Masters of the Safaviyeh order, prior to its ascent to a ruling dynasty. Ismail was known as a brave and charismatic youth, zealous with regards to his Shi’a faith as he believed himself to be of divine descent, being practically worshipped by his Qizilbash followers. And it is through this combination of faith and force of arms that the Safavids have been able to make Persia their own."
 PER_idea2:0 "Dominance of Twelver Shi'ism"
 PER_idea2_desc:0 "Key to the establishment and legitimacy of the Safavid state was the proclamation of Twelver Shi'ism as the state religion by Shah Ismail I. Although previous Shiite dynasties had held lands in Iran, the Safavid Empire brought radical changes to the region as Shah Ismail I sought to completely remove Sunni Islam from Iranian life and politics: the Empire's subjects were forcefully converted to Shia Islam, Sunni Ulema were exiled or killed, Sunni tombs and shrines were demolished, and most importantly, Ismail imported a new Shia Ulama corps from traditional Shiite centers of the Arabic speaking lands, largely from Jabal Amil (of Southern Lebanon), Mount Lebanon, Syria, Eastern Arabia and Southern Iraq in order to create a state clergy, promising them land and money in return for their loyalty. These scholars taught the doctrine of Twelver Shiism and made it accessible to the population and energetically encouraged conversion to Shiism. The Safavids used state patronage to develop Shia shrines, institutions and religious art, and invited all the Shia living outside Iran to come to the Empire and be assured of protection from the Sunni majority. These changes have altered the religious landscape of Iran forever, turning it into the heartland of the Shia faith worldwide."
 PER_idea3:0 "Sepahsalar"
 PER_idea3_desc:0 "Starting as an organized band of religious warriors, discipline has always been of utmost importance to the Safavid realm in their struggle against oftentimes numerically superior enemies. Of the posts that were considered to be "pillars of the state" (rokn ol-dowleh, or arkan ol-dowleh), at least three were from the military administration; the qollar-aghasi, the qurchi-bashi, and the tofangchi-aghasi. At least three of the leading commanding posts had a reserved seat in the small inner council (or privy), known as the janqi. The janqi was a part of the royal council, and was basically responsible for governing the country. Membership of the janqi was limited to the officials of utmost importance. The commander-in-chief (sepahsalar) also joined the inner council when military matters were discussed. This strong organization contributes to the strength of our armies on the field and to the continued cooperation between the Iranian and Turkic elements of our military."
 PER_idea4:0 "Expand the Persian Rug Production"
 PER_idea4_desc:0 "The time of the Safavid dynasty marks one of the greatest periods in Persian art, which includes carpet weaving. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified, and became highly sought after in European markets - many kings began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned peces. These rugs thus not only grant us a priviledged position in the world of trade and arts, but also facilitates strong diplomatic opportunities."
 PER_idea5:0 "Tmrkez"
 PER_idea5_desc:0 "During the reign of Abbas the Great, reforms were undertaken in order to reduce the powers of tribal elements within the Empire and modernize the state institutions. Abbas was able to begin gradually reducing the Empire's reliance on the Qizilbash tribes by transferring provinces from mamalik (provincial) rule governed by a Qizilbash chief and the revenue of which mostly supported local Qizilbash administration and forces to khass (central) rule presided over by a court appointee and the revenue of which reverted to the court. Particularly important in this regard were the Gilan and Mazandaran provinces, which produced Iran's single most important export; silk. With the substantial new revenue, Abbas was able to build up a central, standing army, loyal only to him. This freed him of his dependence on Qizilbash warriors loyal to local tribal chiefs. This centralization effort proved crucial in the continued existence of the Safavid Empire and its benefits are still visible to us now."
 PER_idea6:0 "Westernize the Army"
 PER_idea6_desc:0 "As part of the sweeping reforms Abbas undertook to modernize the army, a key role was fulfilled by English envoys Anthony and Robert Shirley, who had come to Persia in an effort to strike an anti-Ottoman alliance, one of many that the Safavids tried to conclude with European monarchs. They were warmly welcomed and they accepted the task of modernizing the Safavid army to European standards in exchange for trading rights, working together with the powerful Safavid statesman Allahverdi Khan for this purpose. Thanks to these reforms, the numbers and discipline of the Qizilbash, Gholam and Tofangchi corps improved substantially, and the Safavid army could afford to field up to 500 artillery units in battle. These military reforms proved invaluable in scoring major victories on the Safavids' arch-rivals, the Uzbeks and the Ottomans."
 PER_idea7:0 "The Eternal Rivalry"
 PER_idea7_desc:0 "The centuries-long, bloody rivalry between the Ottoman and Safavid empires is the stuff of legends, and profoundly shaped Asian politics, religious life and military history throughout the entire modern era. Starting with the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, which led to the sacking of the Safavid capital of Tabriz, the relations between the two empires constantly alternated between ferocious wars and tenuous truces. As both empires saw themselves as the forerunners of the Islamic faith, the rivalry took on a religious dimension as subjects of either Empire, if found to have the rival's religion, would be suspected of treason. In spite of massive Ottoman numerical and technological superiority however, the Safavid Empire never capitulated and was able to score many impressive victories and conquests of their own against the Sublime Porte, always managing to come back from crushing defeat with formidable military campaigns that pushed the Ottomans all the way back to Anatolia. This resilence against such a formidable adversary makes the Safavid armies unique in the Muslim world."

 AFS_idea1:0 "The Grand Qoroltai"
 AFS_idea1_desc:0 "The Afsharid Dynasty has its origins in the relatively obscure yet bloody inter-factional violence in Khorasan during the collapse of the Safavid state. The small band of warriors under local warlord Nader Qoli of the Turkomen Afshar tribe in north-east Iran were no more than a few hundred men. Yet at the height of Nader's power as the king of kings, Shahanshah, he commanded an army of 375,000 fighting men which constituted the single most powerful military force of its time, led by one of the most talented and successful military leaders of history. Nader's reputation increased after scoring impressive victories against several of Persia's long-standing enemies and winning the support of much of the aristocracy and military establishment of the country in the face of a sharply declining Safavid monarchy. They agreed to crown him Shah after Nader called for a Qoroltai, a grand meeting in the tradition of Genghis Khan and Timur on the Moghan plains. So long as the dynasty continues to be supported by all factions of the empire we will undoubtedly see great progress."
 AFS_idea2:0 "Wartime Innovations"
 AFS_idea2_desc:0 "Part of Nader Shah's brillance in warfare was his ability to come up with effective new strategies to fight against Persia's many powerful adversaries that employed all kinds of formations and tactics. Nader's early campaigns against the Abdali Afghans of western Afghanistan which fielded superior cavalry compelled Nader to seek a tactical solution geared around an infantry solution. The development of this system of having strong firearm infantry to provide a stable pivot around which to position artillery and manoeuvre cavalry allowed Nader to defeat the Abdali horsemen. This represented a remarkable innovation in Persian warfare, because for much of its history infantry was always seen as a secondary force compared to cavalry. Coupled with Nader Shah's military technological advancements, at its peak the Afsharid army was always a step ahead of all its opponents."
 AFS_idea3:0 "Train the Jazyarechi"
 AFS_idea3_desc:0 "The Jazayerchi were the elite of Nader's infantry musketeers, an integral part of the military reforms undertaken during his rule. Jazayerchi were well uniformed and provided with the best equipment, and engaged in training several hours everyday. A clear emphasis was given to constant drilling of the soldiers, as Nader shaped the Jazayerchi corps himself and often took personal command of them in battle. If he saw an ordinary soldier consistently on top form he would promote him to be a leader of 100 men or a leader of 50 men. He encouraged all the soldiers toward bravery, ability and experience, and in simple words he himself gave an example of strong character and military virtue. On the deadly impact of the jazayer during the Battle of Karnal, a contemporary noted, 'An arrow cannot answer a Jazayer'."
 AFS_idea4:0 "Promote the Ja'fari Mazhab"
 AFS_idea4_desc:0 "The Safavid dynasty brought Twelver Shia Islam to Persia, making it the state religion and a fundamental pillar of the empire. Nader Shah however converted to Sunni Islam upon becoming Shah, and though most of his subjects remained Shia he sought to reform religion in the country in order to reduce tensions with Sunni rivals but also to reduce the power of the Safavid loyalists who strongly depended on Shia clerics for their legitimacy. He had the chief mullah of Iran strangled after he was heard expressing support for the Safavids. He wanted Iran to adopt a form of religion that would be more acceptable to Sunnis and suggested that Iran adopt a form of Shi'ism he called "Ja'fari", in honour of the sixth Shi'a imam Ja'far al-Sadiq. He banned certain Shi'a practices which were particularly offensive to Sunnis, such as the cursing of the first three caliphs. Nader hoped that "Ja'farism" would be accepted as a fifth school (mazhab) of Sunni Islam and that the Ottomans would allow its adherents to go on the hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which was within their territory."
 AFS_idea5:0 "Afsharid Discipline"
 AFS_idea5_desc:0 "The Afsharid Army was renowed for its logistical expertise and strict discipline, resulting in extraordinary feats that in many cases remain unparalleled in the history of Central Asia. In an effort to open up an invasion path into the Mughal Empire the Afsharid army needed to overcome a powerful force situated at the narrow Khyber pass, where only a small column of men could hope to march and any deployment into fighting formations would be an impossibility. Nader, after having been informed of a difficult yet traversable pass running parallel to that of Kheibar called the pass of Chatchoobi, began an epic flank-march of over 80 kilometres through some of the most unnavigable terrain in Asia, allowing half of his army to reach the enemy from the rear and thus encircle the Mughal army. During the eight-mong long Central Asian campaign, the Afsharid army had travelled 3,000 km, a logistical and strategic feat even relative to their highly mobile Uzbek opponents. But the most well known example of Nader Shah's army strict discipline was the end of the sack of Delhi. After two days of slaughter, Nader sent out his officers and messengers proclaiming the end of the massacre. The swiftness of the Afsharid army's cessation of hostility was remarkable and many contemporary commentators stated their admiration for the strict discipline of Nader's army."
 AFS_idea6:0 "To Vassalize an Emperor"
 AFS_idea6_desc:0 "The invasion of the massive Mughal Empire represented an unprecedented step in Persian expansionism, as the much smaller Afsharid expeditionary force was able to crush the massive Mughal army and occupy the capital of Delhi. Greatest riches were plundered from the treasuries of the Mughal dynasty's capital. The Peacock Throne was also taken away by the Afsharid army, and thereafter served as a symbol of Persian imperial might. Among a trove of other fabulous jewels, Nader also gained the Koh-i-Noor ("Mountain of Light") and Darya-ye Noor ("Sea of Light") diamonds. Nader Shah then stated his intention to keep the Mughal emperor on the throne and turn him into his vassal, and while the Afsharids did annex all Mughal land east of the Indus, the Mughals were allowed to keep all the other territories the Afsharid army had occupied. This victory represented the height of Afsharids' military campaigns and the plunder seized from India was so rich that Nader stopped taxation in Persia for a period of three years following his return."
 AFS_idea7:0 "From the Indus to the Bosphorus"
 AFS_idea7_desc:0 "Nader Shah dreamed of an empire which would stretch from the Indus to the Bosphorus, similar to Persian empires of antiquity. The Afsharid Empire came close to achieving this dream in the east by a large scale conquest of Central Asia which resulted in the greatest Persian domination of the region in the modern era, as well as a successful expedition into the India which established the Indus as the eastern frontier of the empire. Despite many outstanding victories against the Ottomans Nader Shah died before he could hope to annex most of their lands, but his legacy lives on, and the march to the Bosphorus continues to this day!"

Just as they had sworn fealty to past Shahs they shall do so again for us, and to reward their loyalty, we see it as prudent to re-establish the old Safavid provincial administration system which saw the employment of tribal chieftains as local governors. This should hopefully keep them in line and ensure an efficient administration, and should they ever turn their backs on us again, we will then be in a position to replace them with people closer to our Shah."

We cannot let these upstarts deprive us of our core lands, because we know that if these territories were to fall then our capital would be an easy target for invasion. We must improve the defenses in the Caucasus, build modern-style fortifications and train engineers in the European style to be able to hold the Russians at bay, for their struggle with them will be a long one."
 QJR_idea5:0 "Strengthen the Foreign Office"
 QJR_idea5_desc:0 "Due to our protracted war with Russia we have been unable to effectively maintain military control over certain areas of our Empire, but recent events have shown diplomacy to be a tool as effective as warfare itself. Mahmud Shah Durrani, at war with his own brother over supremacy in Afghanistan, has come to us for help and we have given him enough resources and advisors to carry on his fight, following which he was able to assume control and rule Afghanistan in our stead, whilst we suffered practically no losses of our own. That, and the increasingly importance of diplomatic relations with European powers, have shown that we must have an effective foreign office that is capable to defend our interests at the international stage."

Constantly at odds with eachother, they at times court and at times threaten local governments in our part of the world in order to further their interests. What is more important in this case is that their interests can also be ours. In particular the French and British have long requested an alliance with us, and through signing treaties with them we may be able to employ ever larger numbers of European engineers and army reformers to help modernize our army to once again be a formidable force on the world stage and reduce our dependence on tribal levies."

With the vast British holdings in India on one side and the established Russian military presence in Central Asia on the other, this rivalry risks to squeeze us from both sides. But thanks to our recent reforms, our brilliant legacy, and the steadfast determination of our people, we can still show the world that we are not merely another small state to be toyed with. As our military reforms have rapidly increased the strength and numbers in our army, whoever comes into Persia seeking conquest will leave it seeking forgiveness."

 USI_idea1_desc:0 "Our people have inhabited the oases of the Tarim Basin for millennia, and although the surrounding environment is often hostile and has led our cities to be located quite far away from one another, we still remain united in our faith and shared culture and remain the most powerful force in the region."
 USI_idea2:0 "The Silk Road"
 USI_idea2_desc:0 "Our lands were and still are a prime stopping point for the legendary Silk Road, the largest commercial road in Eurasia, where all sorts of materials traveled westward for the lucrative markets of Europe and the Islamic world. By increasing our control over these routes we'll be sure to gain benefits in the long run."
 USI_idea3:0 "A History of Conflict"
 USI_idea3_desc:0 "We've had to suffer several invasions by foreign powers eager to extend their influence over the lucrative trading oases of the Tarim Basin. Although our borders are porous and we face many potential enemies east, west and north, increasing fortifications in our largest cities is bound to at least discourage many foes from directly attacking us."
 USI_idea4:0 "Legacy of the Chagatai Khanate"
 USI_idea4_desc:0 "Chagatai Khan, second son of the great Khan of the Mongols, made our lands his power base and the resulting polity that followed, the Chagatai Khanate, eventually embraced the one true faith of Islam and allowed our people to attain significantly powerful positions. Though the Khanate fractured in the long run, its legacy survives to this day and all our polities seek to revitalize the strength and power it once had."
 USI_idea5:0 "Internal Division"
 USI_idea5_desc:0 "The fracturing of the Chagatai Khanate led to continued division among our people as several leaders jockeyed for power among themselves and oftentimes plunged our realms into chaos and uncertainty. We must end these divisions and bring all our lands under our continued rule once again."
 USI_idea6:0 "The Twelve Muqam"
 USI_idea6_desc:0 "Among the most treasured cultural artifacts of our people are surely the Twelve Muqam, considered to be the traditional epic of our people. Amannisa Khan, a concubine of Abdurashid Khan of the Yarkent Khanate, is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam."

 PDV_idea1_desc:0 "Ancient tradition from well over 1000 years ago suggests that Padua was founded around 1183 BC by the Trojan prince Antenor, making it one of the oldest cities in Northern Italy. Thus, when a large ancient stone sarcophagus was exhumed in the year 1274, our officials knew the remains were those of Antenor."
 PDV_idea2:0 "Canals on the Bacchiglione"
 PDV_idea2_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the devastating Breach at Cucca altered the flow of rivers in the area and subsequent disrepair led to areas becoming swamps and trade being neglected. The construction of the canals of Battaglia, Piovego and Brentella have significantly increased navigability and benefit our trade routes greatly."
 PDV_idea3:0 "Communal Independence"
 PDV_idea3_desc:0 "Starting from the XI century the position of Padua as one of the key cities of the Northeast was secured thanks to a steady territorial expansion, incorporating many small neighboring towns, and allowing the city to defend itself from hostile invaders from Venice, Vicenza and Verona. Among Padua's celebrated victories, the Battle of Castagnaro is noteworthy as a great military victory and one of the most well known battles of the 'Condottieri age'."
 PDV_idea4:0 "St. Anthony of Padua"
 PDV_idea4_desc:0 "The Portuguese Saint Anthony, renowed for his powerful preaching, expert knowledge of scripture, and undying love and devotion to the poor and the sick, worked and lived for a long time in Padua, and died there in 1231. His veneration spread widely after his death, becoming the patron saint of Padua and later having many churches built in his name in the Portuguese empire, as well as a great Basilica in Padua itself. Looking at his piety and knowledge of the scriptures as an example will surely increase the resolve of our missionaries."
 PDV_idea5:0 "The Padoan Renaissance"
 PDV_idea5_desc:0 "Padua has had a long tradition of supporting artists, and the arrival of famed florentine sculptor Donatello in 1443 triggered a new wave of artistic works in the city, which had already garnered fame thanks to Giotto's work in the XIV century. The Renaissance in Padua led to great development in the entire region as the ideas and techniques later spread to Venice and other cities, and Padua is considered to be along with Florence and Urbino as among the most important early centers of the movement."
 PDV_idea6:0 "Universa Universis Patavina Libertas"
 PDV_idea6_desc:0 "Founded in 1222, the University of Padua is the second oldest in Italy and one of the most prestigious and advanced in Europe, having greatly contributed to the prolification of sciences in the whole continent. Early on it became an important teaching centre for Aristotelism, and later it attracted brilliant inventors and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei. We must make sure to continue this time-honored tradition and keep our nation at the forefront of science and discovery."
 PDV_idea7:0 "City Expansion"
 PDV_idea7_desc:0 "The expansion of Padua was a steady process over the centuries and although many have since wished to incorporate our cities into their own domains, we must instead continue to expand our own territory so that it shall be their domains that will fall under our sphere of influence!"

Through the ages, its importance has not diminished and it remains one of the greatest cities in the region."
 BHK_idea2:0 "A View of the Land"
 BHK_idea2_desc:0 "The lands surrounding Balkh vary greatly in their characteristics, with the great mountain ranges in the south sheltering us from invasions, and the flat plains in the north allowing many settlements to be built. This great divergence in land types has therefore meant that our armies must be used to different conditions to be able to operate efficiently."
 BHK_idea3:0 "Agricultural Progress"
 BHK_idea3_desc:0 "In order to maintain our city's prosperity and the continued well being of our people and armies, it is important to develop the agricultural lands in the northern regions to maximize their efficiency. Without having to rely so much on imported crops we'll be able to better deal with any time of crisis."
 BHK_idea4:0 "Great Trade Routes"
 BHK_idea4_desc:0 "Balkh is one of the most important trading posts in the region, with caravans coming from as far away as India and China and onwards to the western lands. Increasing our control over these trade routes will net us impressive riches."
 BHK_idea5:0 "The Great Reconstruction"
 BHK_idea5_desc:0 "The city of Balkh was almost completely levelled during the invasion of the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan, and suffered further destruction during the invasion of Timur. Fortunately, the great emperor Shah Rukh, successor of Timur, rebuilt most of the city thus allowing it to once again become a prosperous center of trade and learning. Having gone through difficult times such as these we understand that it's always possible to recover in the end."
 BHK_idea6:0 "The Green Mosque"
 BHK_idea6_desc:0 "Among the most impressive constructs dating from the Shah Rukh era is undoubtedly the Green Mosque: a magnificent place of worship built in a style that would later be much imitated elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as by the famous Taj Mahal of India. Having such beautiful buildings within our walls gives our people a sense of solace."
 BHK_idea7:0 "An Independent Khanate"
 BHK_idea7_desc:0 "The Mughal and Safavid empires vied for supremacy in the region, but it was after the death of Nader Shah that our city was once again given a chance at independence. A local commander, Hadji Khan, seized the opportunity to proclaim Balkh an independent Khanate, but with growing pressure from the Khanate of Bakhara from the north, only strength of arms will be able to secure our independence in the long run."

Just as we were able to preserve our identity after the fall of the Roman Empire, we have been able to hold true to our values and look forward to prospering times ahead!"
 SYL_idea2:0 "Beyond the Forest"
 SYL_idea2_desc:0 "The terrain of Transylvania is treacherous and unforgiving for the uninitiated, which has allowed us to defend ourselves against many of the invaders that have passed through here over the centuries. Just as then, anyone who thinks of conquering this land will have to fight harshly to get it."
 SYL_idea3:0 "Transylvanian Agriculture"
 SYL_idea3_desc:0 "Our people have worked the land and tended to our flocks for generations, and although the Hungarians and Germans think lowly of our status as peasants and shepherds, our activities are what keeps Transylvania afloat. Such a strong agricultural foundation would greatly benefit an independent state in the region just the same..."

 SYL_idea5:0 "Boyars of Fogaras"
 SYL_idea5_desc:0 "Although the Hungarians have long been the masters of Transylvania, an increasingly high number of Romanian Boyars have occupied important positions in the land. As they rise in numbers and importance, we may finally have the means of acquiring independence and prosperity once and for all."
 SYL_idea6:0 "Under Mihai Bravu"
 SYL_idea6_desc:0 "The great conqueror of Wallachia, Michael the Brave, managed to briefly hold Transylvania at the turn of the 17th century, marking the first time that a Romanian prince would hold control over the vast principality. Even though his sudden assassination brought the old powers in charge again, Mihai is a source of great inspiration for us as he has shown us - and all Romanians - the way forward to independence and greatness. "
 SYL_idea7:0 "Transylvanian School"
 SYL_idea7_desc:0 "The Transylvanian School (Scoala Ardeleana) was a cultural movement that began in the 18th century and led to the spread of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment to the Transylvanian Romanians. The Transylvanian School had a notable impact in the Romanian culture of both Transylvania, but also of the Romanians living across the Carpathians, in Wallachia and Moldavia, leading to the national awakening of Romania. The Transylvanian School created the current phonetic system of the Romanian alphabet based on the Latin alphabet, and its leading members in 1791 sent the memorandum 'Supplex Libellus Valachorum Transsilvaniae' to the Habsburg Emperor. In this memorandum, they demanded similar rights for the Transylvanian Romanians as those enjoyed by the (largely) Hungarian nobility, the enfranchised Saxon patrician class, and the free military Székelys under the Union of the Three Nations."

Monarchs would be empowered with a veto right in this regard.

They were the first modern European army due to Tercio units being comprised of professional volunteers, rather than levies or mercenaries, and their pioneer usage of combined arms, being the first to efficiently mix pikes with firearms.\n\nThe emphasis on maintaining a high number of 'viejos soldados' (veterans), together with the particular personality imprinted on them by the proud hidalgos of the lower nobility that nurtured them, made the tercios for more than two centuries the best infantry in Europe."

Unlike other armies raised for previous conflicts, the New Model Army was intended to be liable for service anywhere in the country, including Ireland and Scotland, rather than being tied to a single area or garrison. Due to the deeply Puritan religious beliefs held by many veterans who formed it, the army's leaders were prohibited from having seats in either the House of Lords or House of Commons.\n\nAs a result of this separation between political and military life, the army's generals became a very professional officer corps and the New Model Army turned into a full-time professional army, the first in the three kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland, proving supreme in the field.\n\nAlthough eventually disbanded by Charles II after the restoration, many of its regiments were integrated into what was now the British Army, with its legacy of a smaller, highly professional army living on to this day."

At the same time additional Poor Laws were passed requiring parishes to have a store of 'wool, hemp, flax, iron', so that the poor could be set to work, creating a new effective and cheap workforce."
