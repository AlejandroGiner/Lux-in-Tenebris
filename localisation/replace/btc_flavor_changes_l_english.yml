 persian_footsoldierDESCR:0 "While often lacking a professional military background, the Berber warriors hardened by centuries of warfare as well as the harsh desert environment in which they live could hardly be considered anything but formidable. Typically armed with spears as well as daggers such as the Telek for quick strikes against nearby opponents, Berbers could often prove to be tough opponents even for professional armies."
 mamluk_archer:0 "Halqa Guard" #1
 mamluk_archerDESCR:0 "In the vast domains of the Mamluk Sultanate the 'Halqa' represented the non-Mamluk military units of the realm, typically consisting of local Arabs or other ethnicities such as Kurdish bands and other elements that had become scattered following the chaos of the Mongol invasions. Whilst their training did not reach the level of professionalism of the Mamluks and their presence in the Sultanate's formal armies declined starting from the 14th century, they still proved useful and determined troops which could be found stationed in military posts across the Levant and North Africa."
 mamluk_duel:0 "Mamluk Composite Bowman" #5
 mamluk_duelDESCR:0 "Among the Mamluk soldiers the preferred military art was that of archery, and every member of the contingent was expected to be proficent at it, a task made easier by the popularity of archery as a recreational sport among the units. These Mamluks used composite bows to great effect against enemy infantry and cavalry alike and remained much feared throughout the 14th and 15th centuries."
 persian_shamshir:0 "Levantine Kilij Swordsman" #9
 persian_shamshirDESCR:0 "The Mongol and Crusader invasions on the Muslim lands led to the takeover of major arms production centers, initiating a decline of traditional Arab sword manufactory that, coupled with the emergence of Turkish empires in the late middle ages, resulted in the eventual abandonment of traditional double-edged swords traditionally found in Islamic armies in favor of curved Turkish blades such as the Kilij of Ottoman fame. The Levantines, owing to their close proximity to Anatolia and long history of Turkish incursion into the region, were among the first to adopt this weapon for their armed contingents and used them to great effect in combat."
 afsharid_reformed_infantry:0 "Tulbah Exilees" #15
 afsharid_reformed_infantryDESCR:0 "Mismanagement and corruption in Ottoman Egypt led to a severe local government crisis and at the beginning of the 17th century mutinies among Mamluks in the army became common. The reason for these mutinies was the attempt made by successive pashas to put a stop to the extortion called the tulbah, a forced payment exacted by the troops from the inhabitants of the country by the fiction of debts requiring to be discharged, which led to grievous ill-usage. When Mehmed Pasha came into office, his strong-handed methods and personality allowed him to suppress the sipahis and abolish the illegal tulba protection tax they had been imposing on the Egyptian countryside. Tensions came to a head in February 1609, when the rebels gathered in the city of Tanta and met at the tomb of Ahmad al-Badawi, Egypt's most popular saint, to swear that they would resist Mehmed Pasha's efforts; they then began to gather troops and pillage villages for supplies. The soldiers went so far as to choose a sultan, and to provisionally divide the regions of Cairo between them. Mehmed Pasha's forces met the rebels just north of Cairo. The rebels, discouraged, lost the battle, and the pasha's forces summarily executed over 250 of them, while others were later exiled to peripheral areas of the empire including Yemen. Even though they lost that key battle, the 'Tulbah' rebels represented the largest independent Mamluk forces since the times of the Sultanate in Cairo, and even if exiled their fighting prowess remained."
 durrani_rifled_musketeer:0 "Qassimite Militia" #23
 durrani_rifled_musketeerDESCR:0 "Political supremacy once again shifted back to the Mamluks in Egypt at the beginning of the 18th century, in particular to the Qassimite faction that had opposed the Fiqarites (to whom Ridwan Bey belonged) since the last century.  The leader of the first faction had been appointed as treasurer, while the lead of the second as head of the pilgrimage. An accelerating cycle of revolts and disturbances culminated in the 'Great Sedition', several years of friction climaxing in three months of armed conflict in early 1711. This was exacerbated by the political meddling of the 'Azab armored troopers and the Janissaries, who backed the Qassimites and Fiqarites respectively. The Qassimites secured a decisive victory in 1711 that would guarantee their supremacy in Egypt for the following years. By this point, the Ottoman walis have been thoroughly eclipsed; politically, Mamluk Egypt is independent in all but name, and even this was soon going to change with the arrival of Ali Bey to the scene."
 muslim_mass_infantry:0 "Ali Bey's Mamluk"
 muslim_mass_infantryDESCR:0 "Ali Bey, nicknamed the "Cloud-catcher", represented the last Mamluk attempt at maintaining the historical Mamluk privileges in Egypt and obtaining independence from Constantinople before the takeover of Egypt by Muhammad Ali. Having grown up as a protege of the powerful Qazdagli faction, he rose through the ranks until he achieved Shaykh al-Balad, the highest possible rank for a Mamluk, in 1760.\n\nIn 1768, Ali Bey deposed the Ottoman governor Rakım Mehmed Pasha and assumed the post of acting governor. He stopped the annual tribute to the Sublime Porte and in an unprecedented usurpation of the Ottoman Sultan's privileges had his name struck on local coins in 1769 (alongside the sultan's emblem), effectively declaring Egypt's independence from Ottoman rule. In 1770 he gained control of the Hijaz and a year later temporarily occupied Syria, thereby reconstituting the Mamluk state that had disappeared in 1517.\n\nDuring his time in power, he successfully expanded Egypt's trade with Britain and France. He also hired European advisers to the military and bought European weapons, allowing his Mamluk army to stand a chance against the Ottoman forces that had bested them years before. Though his rule was short-lived, it represented the last hurrah for the long-running Mamluk caste before their elimination at the beginning of the 19th century."
 persian_rifle:0 "Najd Warrior"
 persian_rifleDESCR:0 "The Wahhabis launched a series of wars against all neighboring tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries, fighting the Shammars and Bani Khalids, as well as more powerful nations such as Oman, Kuwait and most importantly, Egypt itself. The long conflicts that were sparked by the religious movement would continue unabated for decades but the reckoning for the original Saudi leadership came with the Egyptian invasion, which led to the execution of the Saudi king and the destruction of the original capital, Diriyah. This temporarily allowed the old tribes to regain control, but by the mid 18th century, the Wahhabis would rise again, and blood would once again be spilled in the desert."

 #PROTESTANT -> LUTHERAN

 protestant_religion_desc:1 "Lutheranism is a major branch of western Christianity that identifies with the teaching of Martin Luther, a 16th century German reformer. Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation. The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings, beginning with the 95 Theses, divided Western Christianity. Luther sought to reform the Western Church to what he considered a more biblical foundation, going against a number of the conventions that over time have developed in the Catholic church and even going against the idea of a pope itself. Unlike Calvinism, Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church, with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper. Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology, divine grace, the purpose of God's Law, the concept of perseverance of the saints, and predestination.\nIn the game Lutheranism will take hold in Europe starting from the 16th century and covers mainly countries inspired by Luther's teachings and who have formed state churches as well as minor related Protestant groups."

It broke into revolt against the authority of the Caliph Ali after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, Muawiyah I, to decide the succession to the Caliphate following the Battle of Siffin (657). A Kharijite later assassinated Ali, and for hundreds of years, the Khawarij were a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.\nThe Khawarij oppose arbitration as a means to choose a new ruler on the grounds that "judgement belongs to God alone". They consider arbitration a means for people to make decisions while the victor in a battle was determined by God. They believe that any Muslim—even one who was not a Quraysh or even an Arab—could be the Imam, the leader of the community, if he was morally irreproachable, and if the leader sinned, it is the duty of Muslims to oppose and depose him. This differs from the position of both Sunnis, who later went on accept the leadership of those in power, and Shi'a, who were to assert that the leadership rightly belonged to Ali and his descendants.\nKharijites also asserted that faith without accompanying deeds is useless and anyone who goes against injunctions of religion is an apostate and a polytheist and must repent to reenter the religion else he would be subject to death.\nAlthough once powerful and widespread, following bitter conflicts and intense warfare, many Khawarij were driven out of the lands under the Caliphates, and by 1444 only a handful of independent Khawarij states remain, all following the Ibadi sect."

Due to an unstable and travelling family, Cervantes did not do university studies, although it is presumed his first studies could've been in either Valladolid, Córdoba or Sevilla.\n\nIn 1566 he moved to Madrid to study in the royal institution 'Estudio de la Villa', where he showed his first recorded literary skills, when Cervantes' teacher and mentor López de Hoyos included two of Cervantes' poems in his own book. It is also here where he develops an interest for theather, attending to several performances by Lope de Rueda, one of the first Spanish actors.\n\nAfter an unfortunate event in a duel that causes Philip II of Spain to call for his arrest, Cervantes flees to Roma, Italy, place from which he would draw much inspiration for his later work and how to approach romantic themes. Cervantes was so charmed by the eternal city that he wrote several pieces about it, even creating an entire tourist guide about the city.\n\nContinuing his adventures through Italy working as chamber assistant of cardinal Giulio Acquaviva, Cervantes saw himself involved in the Battle of Lepanto, where after receiving a bad wound on his hand received the nickname of 'the One-handed of Lepanto', even though he didn't fully lost his hand. After 5 years of prison under the Berber corsairs, he finally returned to Spain in 1580.\n\nIt was during these last years of his life that he started his literary career while working as tax collector, quickly becoming a succesful writer and consolidating his legacy as the greatest writer in the Spanish language one of history's most prominent novelists, with his widely recognized as the first modern novel and best work of fiction ever written 'Don Quijote' being the most translated-book in the world after the Bible, being available in more than 140 languages.

 #Ideas
 #Bulgaria rework, Dynamo
 bul_idea_1:0 "Nezavisimost"
 bul_idea_1_desc:0 "Bulgaria fractured into multiple principalities in the 14th century before being finally subjugated by the Turks. Yet on this day, we have created a new, free Tsardom, ready to follow in the steps of our forefathers to restore the glory of Bulgaria. No amount of repression has kept our people at bay for at this point we have been able to withstand any blow for the glory of our nation. Svoboda ili smart!"
 bul_idea_2:0 "Bulgarian Orthodox Church"
 bul_idea_2_desc:0 "A fundamental pillar of our society has always been the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the keepers of the faith, the one faith that even in all these troubled centuries kept our people together like nothing else could've. This institution has long been in decline but it is time to reinstate it and propagate the word of God in these lands once again."
 bul_idea_3:0 "Support the Komitadji"
 bul_idea_3_desc:0 "Even though we have secured our independence and unity many of our brethren still remain confined in lands that are not under our direct control. These komitadji, as they are known in our enemy's tongue, deserve our full support in their own struggle for liberation, for their goals match our own and our objective of establishing our rule throughout all of historical Bulgaria is seen as deliverance by our oppressed brothers."
 bul_idea_4:0 "Repopulate the Cities"
 bul_idea_4_desc:0 "The occupiers burned certain cities to the ground and overall led to severe depopulation in Bulgaria due to their monstrous raids against the civilian population. For us to be a regional power once again it is of key importance that we restore our great cities to their former glory, elevating them to the status of centers of learning and production that they possessed centuries ago. People from East and West alike will come to Tarnovo and Sofia to witness the triumph of the Bulgarian state."
 bul_idea_5:0 "Bulgarian National Revival"
 bul_idea_5_desc:0 "The Bulgarian National Revival, also called Bulgarian Renaissance, was a period of period of socio-economic development and national integration for the Bulgarians still living under occupied lands, generally accepted to have begun with the publication of Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya, written in 1762 by Paisius, a Bulgarian monk of the Hilandar monastery at Mount Athos.\n\nInfluenced by Western thinking, the period is remarkable for its characteristic architecture which can still be observed in old Bulgarian towns such as Tryavna, Koprivshtitsa and Veliko Tarnovo, the rich literary heritage of authors like Ivan Vazov and Hristo Botev that inspired the Bulgarian struggle for independence and an autonomous church.. The significant changes in the Bulgarian society, the freedom of economic initiative and religious choice led to the formation of the Bulgarian nation in its ethnic borders and common territory embracing the lands of Moesia, Dobruja, Thrace and Macedonia."
 bul_idea_6:0 "Wrestling For Self-Determination"
 bul_idea_6_desc:0 "Many great powers in Europe and beyond seek to use Bulgaria for their puny goals, from Russia to the Habsburgs to the Ottomans. They act as if they can decide what our borders should be and who we should be allied to. But thanks to our multiple victories in battle against armies that are more technologically advanced than we are, we have showcased them that our will cannot be broken so easily. These battles have allowed us to master new defensive tactics that we can employ against these new artillery pieces being introduced in the battlefield."
 bul_idea_7:0 "Shield of the East"
 bul_idea_7_desc:0 "Our military reputation has risen to the point that the French military has called our own armies the finest of Eastern Europe. It took untold suffering to get to this point but we are now a regional power that can decide politics for the entirety of the Balkans and beyond. Onwards to Victory!"
 
 #USA tweaks, Helena
 empire_of_liberty_desc:0 "From the repressed peoples of South America, to our ravaged by war European brethren, to the victims of terror and those prosecuted for their religion, our fledgling Republic is viewed as an inspiration to the entire human race. Having bled against tyranny and oppression ourselves, ours is the responsibility to spread freedom across the world."
 usa_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'"
 
 #Poland rework, contribution by HotShokomi
 winged_hussars_desc:0 "Originally light cavalry troops used for scouting, the Polish hussars, often called 'Winged Hussars' and affectionately dubbed 'The Angels of Death' by our enemies, have been a part of our party for a while. Donned in a light plate with decorative white feathered wings, they have proven to not only strike fear into our foes but to also inspire our troops to fight on. Their countless successes in battle warrant a larger scale integration into our army to form the core of our new Heavy Shock Cavalry. Their charges shall make the earth tremble and their enemies run before them."
 wojsko_komputoe_desc:0 "Comprising various military units, Wojsko Komputowe (Comput Army) integrated both Polish-born soldiers as well as foreign mercenaries paid by the Diet. Despite a number of funds being instituted by the Diet (with their costs being calculated, or 'computed'), these units were most often paid in part by the Hetman from their own personal wealth during times of peace. Due to the aggressive neighbours of Poland and constant cossack raids, large numbers of troops were maintained at all times and the army was ready to employ mercenaries to replenish their ranks."
