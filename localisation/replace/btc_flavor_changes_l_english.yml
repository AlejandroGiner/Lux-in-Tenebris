 ottoman_janissaryDESCR:0 "Ottoman superior firepower wasn't limited to artillery, but also to the early and widespread adoption of firearms. Quickly after the first musket appeared in 1465, the Ottomans began to use for firearm production what is known as Damascus Steel. Named after its place of origin where it was smithed, Syria, this steel was reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.\n\nThe quality of Ottoman firearms was noted by Ming China writer Zhao Shizhen, who described them as superior to European muskets."

 ottoman_sekbanDESCR:0 "Ottoman superior firepower wasn't limited to artillery, but also to the early and widespread adoption of firearms. Janissary regiments during the 16th century mastered the use of firearms not just as support to classic close combat, but as the main weapon of choice. Janissaries are reportedly the first recorded soldier to make use of volley fire with firearms, or make use of kneeling position row fire, a practice that would later become the bread and butter of European warfare."

 persian_footsoldier:0 "Berber Spearman" #1
 persian_footsoldierDESCR:0 "While often lacking a professional military background, the Berber warriors hardened by centuries of warfare as well as the harsh desert environment in which they live could hardly be considered anything but formidable. Typically armed with spears as well as daggers such as the Telek for quick strikes against nearby opponents, Berbers could often prove to be tough opponents even for professional armies."
 mamluk_archer:0 "Halqa Guard" #1
 mamluk_archerDESCR:0 "In the vast domains of the Mamluk Sultanate the 'Halqa' represented the non-Mamluk military units of the realm, typically consisting of local Arabs or other ethnicities such as Kurdish bands and other elements that had become scattered following the chaos of the Mongol invasions. Whilst their training did not reach the level of professionalism of the Mamluks and their presence in the Sultanate's formal armies declined starting from the 14th century, they still proved useful and determined troops which could be found stationed in military posts across the Levant and North Africa."
 mamluk_duel:0 "Mamluk Composite Bowman" #5
 mamluk_duelDESCR:0 "Among the Mamluk soldiers the preferred military art was that of archery, and every member of the contingent was expected to be proficent at it, a task made easier by the popularity of archery as a recreational sport among the units. These Mamluks used composite bows to great effect against enemy infantry and cavalry alike and remained much feared throughout the 14th and 15th centuries."
 persian_shamshir:0 "Levantine Kilij Swordsman" #9
 persian_shamshirDESCR:0 "The Mongol and Crusader invasions on the Muslim lands led to the takeover of major arms production centers, initiating a decline of traditional Arab sword manufactory that, coupled with the emergence of Turkish empires in the late middle ages, resulted in the eventual abandonment of traditional double-edged swords traditionally found in Islamic armies in favor of curved Turkish blades such as the Kilij of Ottoman fame. The Levantines, owing to their close proximity to Anatolia and long history of Turkish incursion into the region, were among the first to adopt this weapon for their armed contingents and used them to great effect in combat."
 afsharid_reformed_infantry:0 "Tulbah Exilees" #15
 afsharid_reformed_infantryDESCR:0 "Mismanagement and corruption in Ottoman Egypt led to a severe local government crisis and at the beginning of the 17th century mutinies among Mamluks in the army became common. The reason for these mutinies was the attempt made by successive pashas to put a stop to the extortion called the tulbah, a forced payment exacted by the troops from the inhabitants of the country by the fiction of debts requiring to be discharged, which led to grievous ill-usage. When Mehmed Pasha came into office, his strong-handed methods and personality allowed him to suppress the sipahis and abolish the illegal tulba protection tax they had been imposing on the Egyptian countryside. Tensions came to a head in February 1609, when the rebels gathered in the city of Tanta and met at the tomb of Ahmad al-Badawi, Egypt's most popular saint, to swear that they would resist Mehmed Pasha's efforts; they then began to gather troops and pillage villages for supplies. The soldiers went so far as to choose a sultan, and to provisionally divide the regions of Cairo between them. Mehmed Pasha's forces met the rebels just north of Cairo. The rebels, discouraged, lost the battle, and the pasha's forces summarily executed over 250 of them, while others were later exiled to peripheral areas of the empire including Yemen. Even though they lost that key battle, the 'Tulbah' rebels represented the largest independent Mamluk forces since the times of the Sultanate in Cairo, and even if exiled their fighting prowess remained."
 durrani_rifled_musketeer:0 "Qassimite Militia" #23
 durrani_rifled_musketeerDESCR:0 "Political supremacy once again shifted back to the Mamluks in Egypt at the beginning of the 18th century, in particular to the Qassimite faction that had opposed the Fiqarites (to whom Ridwan Bey belonged) since the last century.  The leader of the first faction had been appointed as treasurer, while the lead of the second as head of the pilgrimage. An accelerating cycle of revolts and disturbances culminated in the 'Great Sedition', several years of friction climaxing in three months of armed conflict in early 1711. This was exacerbated by the political meddling of the 'Azab armored troopers and the Janissaries, who backed the Qassimites and Fiqarites respectively. The Qassimites secured a decisive victory in 1711 that would guarantee their supremacy in Egypt for the following years. By this point, the Ottoman walis have been thoroughly eclipsed; politically, Mamluk Egypt is independent in all but name, and even this was soon going to change with the arrival of Ali Bey to the scene."
 muslim_mass_infantry:0 "Ali Bey's Mamluk"
 muslim_mass_infantryDESCR:0 "Ali Bey, nicknamed the "Cloud-catcher", represented the last Mamluk attempt at maintaining the historical Mamluk privileges in Egypt and obtaining independence from Constantinople before the takeover of Egypt by Muhammad Ali. Having grown up as a protege of the powerful Qazdagli faction, he rose through the ranks until he achieved Shaykh al-Balad, the highest possible rank for a Mamluk, in 1760.\n\nIn 1768, Ali Bey deposed the Ottoman governor Raqim Mehmed Pasha and assumed the post of acting governor. He stopped the annual tribute to the Sublime Porte and in an unprecedented usurpation of the Ottoman Sultan's privileges had his name struck on local coins in 1769 (alongside the sultan's emblem), effectively declaring Egypt's independence from Ottoman rule. In 1770 he gained control of the Hijaz and a year later temporarily occupied Syria, thereby reconstituting the Mamluk state that had disappeared in 1517.\n\nDuring his time in power, he successfully expanded Egypt's trade with Britain and France. He also hired European advisers to the military and bought European weapons, allowing his Mamluk army to stand a chance against the Ottoman forces that had bested them years before. Though his rule was short-lived, it represented the last hurrah for the long-running Mamluk caste before their elimination at the beginning of the 19th century."
 persian_rifle:0 "Najd Warrior"
 persian_rifleDESCR:0 "The Wahhabis launched a series of wars against all neighboring tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries, fighting the Shammars and Bani Khalids, as well as more powerful nations such as Oman, Kuwait and most importantly, Egypt itself. The long conflicts that were sparked by the religious movement would continue unabated for decades but the reckoning for the original Saudi leadership came with the Egyptian invasion, which led to the execution of the Saudi king and the destruction of the original capital, Diriyah. This temporarily allowed the old tribes to regain control, but by the mid 18th century, the Wahhabis would rise again, and blood would once again be spilled in the desert."
 mamluk_cavalry_charge:0 "Mamluk Charge Cavalry" #1
 mamluk_cavalry_chargeDESCR:0 "The Mamluks' skill in warfare was amply demonstrated during the crusades, and in particular the decisive victories at Hattin in 1187 and at Ain Jalut in 1260 cemented their reputation as one of the world's foremost fighting groups. Their tactics had changed little since then, favoring highly mobile cavalry that was perfectly capable of cutting armies in two and thus allowing one of the two halves to be annihilated almost effortlessly, as well as expertly charging at enemy armies only to retreat at a moment's notice."
 persian_cavalry_charge:0 "Berber Light Cavalry"
 persian_cavalry_chargeDESCR:0 "The Berber tribes of the deserts of North Africa have prowled the sand dunes since time immemorial, their hardy horse and camel riders hardened by years of conflict with invaders and inter-tribal fighting. Though changing little over the years these Berber cavalry units proved to be an irresistible military force for centuries."
 shaybani:0 "Mamluk Horse Archers"
 shaybaniDESCR:0 "Among the favorite passtimes of the Mamluk caste were horsemanship and archery. It is only natural, then that both of these arts translated into exceptionally skilled mounted archers that could strike fear in the hearts of any army. These units remained the elite cavalry forces of the Mamluk Sultanate and nearby states well into the Ottoman conquest."
 qizilbash_cavalry_unit:0 "al-Ghazali's Cavalry"
 qizilbash_cavalry_unitDESCR:0 "Janbirdi al-Ghazali was one of the men chiefly responsible for the disastrous outcome of the Battle of Marj Dabiq, during which the Mamluk sultan al-Ghawri was killed. Betraying his own field to side with the Ottomans, he was afterwards rewarded with governorship of much of the Levant.\n\nHowever, he soon rose in revolt against his new Ottoman suzerains, apparently intending to re-establish the same Sultanate he had helped bring down. His cavalry units would quickly seize control of most of Syria, and would remain a significant military threat to Ottoman control of the Levant until al-Ghazali's defeat and subsequent execution."
 topchis_artillery:0 "Saadian Cavalry"
 topchis_artilleryDESCR:0 "Between the 15th and 16th centuries Morocco faced a prolonged period of decline under the Wattasid dynasty, which proved unable to resist Portuguese incursions and to rein in several different rival factions that threatened to take the throne for themselves. Among these was the Saadi dynasty hailing from the south of Morocco, who were eventually able to vanquish the decadent Wattasidsat the Battle of Tadla in 1554.\n\nFacing as many enemies as they did, their cavalry units rapidly moved across the entire region and pacified the provinces. They then proceeded to launch several successful expeditions against the Portuguese, recovering much of the stolen territory, and culminating in the conquest of the Touat and key Moroccan victories against the Portuguese at Alcácer Quibir and against the Songhai Empire at Tondibi."
 afsharid_reformed:0 "Anazzah Cavalry"
 afsharid_reformedDESCR:0 "The modern tribe of Annazah became prominent in the Ottoman era, as masters of the oasis towns in northwestern Arabia.  Although not farmers themselves, the Annizah levied crops from the inhabitants, and only spent the winter months in the area, while migrating northwards into southern Syria in the summer months, where they collected tribute from the inhabitants of the Hawran region.\n\nOther clans of the tribe spread across the northern Arabian steppes as far north and east as the Euphrates. They thus became among the most prestigious and powerful tribal confederations in Arabia and beyond, outcompeting several tribes that had previously reigned in these lands, with their skilled cavalry capable of raiding lands across several different regions. Together with the Bani Sakhr tribe, the Anazzah partook in raids against the Ottoman caravans headed to Mecca, with these attacks culminating in the infamous 1757 Hajj caravan raid which led to a significant political crisis within the Ottoman Empire."
 ali_bey_reformed_infantryDESCR:0 "The Mamluk sultanate was briefly reinstated under the reign of Ali Bey al-Kabir in the 1760s, marking the most significant challenge faced by the Ottomans in that regions ever since the 16th century campaign that conquered it. Ali Bey's cavalry was equipped with freshly imported European weapons, and were able to wage successful campaigns across the Levant and the Hejaz for several years, hastening the demise of Ottoman control of these areas.\n\nWhile Ali Bey was ultimately killed a decade later, this rebellion marked both the last attempt at Mamluk independence for Egypt and also foreshadowed the beginning of the end of Ottoman administration of the region, with the rise of Muhammad Ali the following century."
 durrani_dragoon:0 "Egyptian Reformed Cavalry"
 durrani_dragoonDESCR:0 "Under Muhammad Ali of Egypt, the military was greatly reformed and brought up to modern standards, and cavalry was no exception. Muhammad Ali paid great attention to it, because among his most notable personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of Arabian horses.\nIn horses obtained as taxes and tribute, Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the Bedouin, particularly by the Anazzah in Syria and those bred in the Nejd.\n\nHis successor Abbas I shared this interest and further built upon his work, and the Egyptian cavalry units proved formidable in the Egyptian campaigns against the Ottomans in Syria and beyond, campaigns that could have gone all the way to Constantinople if not for the European diplomatic intervention that restored the status quo."
 durrani_swivel:0 "Najd Mounted Warrior"
 durrani_swivelDESCR:0 "The 18th century was an era of great conflict in the Najd due to the wars between the Wahhabis of the desert and several neighboring states, such as Egypt, Shammar and Oman. Having to cover great distances in the desert cavalry was of utmost importance in these conflicts, as the Saudis constantly raided the cities and military encampments of their Egyptian and Omani enemies, who in turn responded by launching cavalry-led expeditions against the Saudi cities deep in the hinterland of Arabia.\nThough both the First and Second Saudi states were destined to fall, the legacy of these conflicts remains evident in Arabia to the present day."

Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation. The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings, beginning with the 95 Theses, divided Western Christianity. Luther sought to reform the Western Church to what he considered a more biblical foundation, going against a number of the conventions that over time have developed in the Catholic church and even going against the idea of a pope itself. Unlike Calvinism, Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church, with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper. Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology, divine grace, the purpose of God's Law, the concept of perseverance of the saints, and predestination.\nIn the game Lutheranism will take hold in Europe starting from the 16th century and covers mainly countries inspired by Luther's teachings and who have formed state churches as well as minor related Protestant groups."

It broke into revolt against the authority of the Caliph Ali after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, Muawiyah I, to decide the succession to the Caliphate following the Battle of Siffin (657). A Kharijite later assassinated Ali, and for hundreds of years, the Khawarij were a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.\nThe Khawarij oppose arbitration as a means to choose a new ruler on the grounds that "judgement belongs to God alone". They consider arbitration a means for people to make decisions while the victor in a battle was determined by God. They believe that any Muslim—even one who was not a Quraysh or even an Arab—could be the Imam, the leader of the community, if he was morally irreproachable, and if the leader sinned, it is the duty of Muslims to oppose and depose him. This differs from the position of both Sunnis, who later went on accept the leadership of those in power, and Shi'a, who were to assert that the leadership rightly belonged to Ali and his descendants.\nKharijites also asserted that faith without accompanying deeds is useless and anyone who goes against injunctions of religion is an apostate and a polytheist and must repent to reenter the religion else he would be subject to death.\nAlthough once powerful and widespread, following bitter conflicts and intense warfare, many Khawarij were driven out of the lands under the Caliphates, and by 1444 only a handful of independent Khawarij states remain, all following the Ibadi sect."

 tengri_events.9.d:0 "The Khawarij community of [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] is home to many religious scholars, men of learning who interpret the holy texts and the ways they can be used to rule fairly and righteously in legal matters. Due to the great influence of the Ibadis in our society at large the results of these scholars are starting to spread throughout our country and have a profound effect on the view of rulership and righteousness."

 flavor_spa.EVTDESC1100:0 "Miguel de Cervantes was an early modern period Spanish soldier, playwright, novelist, poet and accountant born in Alcalá de Henares in 1547. Due to an unstable and travelling family, Cervantes did not do university studies, although it is presumed his first studies could've been in either Valladolid, Córdoba or Sevilla.\n\nIn 1566 he moved to Madrid to study in the royal institution 'Estudio de la Villa', where he showed his first recorded literary skills, when Cervantes' teacher and mentor López de Hoyos included two of Cervantes' poems in his own book. It is also here where he develops an interest for theather, attending to several performances by Lope de Rueda, one of the first Spanish actors.\n\nAfter an unfortunate event in a duel that causes Philip II of Spain to call for his arrest, Cervantes flees to Roma, Italy, place from which he would draw much inspiration for his later work and how to approach romantic themes. Cervantes was so charmed by the eternal city that he wrote several pieces about it, even creating an entire tourist guide about the city.\n\nContinuing his adventures through Italy working as chamber assistant of cardinal Giulio Acquaviva, Cervantes saw himself involved in the Battle of Lepanto, where after receiving a bad wound on his hand received the nickname of 'the One-handed of Lepanto', even though he didn't fully lost his hand. After 5 years of prison under the Berber corsairs, he finally returned to Spain in 1580.\n\nIt was during these last years of his life that he started his literary career while working as tax collector, quickly becoming a succesful writer and consolidating his legacy as the greatest writer in the Spanish language one of history's most prominent novelists, with his widely recognized as the first modern novel and best work of fiction ever written 'Don Quijote' being the most translated-book in the world after the Bible, being available in more than 140 languages. His influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often called 'the language of Cervantes'."
 flavor_spa.EVTDESC1003:0 "The Casa de la Contratación de Indias (House of Trade of the Indies) was a crown agency established by Isabella I in 1503 to encourage navigation with Spanish territories overseas. Initially created to oversee all aspects of colonization, it got replaced in this matter by the Council of Indies and the Casa instead focused on trade with the New World, voyages of exploration and protecting secret information on new trade routes and discoveries.\n\nWith the broadening of the expanding Spanish Empire's ambitions and the increase in American imports, the Casa drastically increased its number of employees and was granted several special privileges. By 1550 it was a well regulated body, with its own chapel and jail, and anyone who would break any of the Casa's laws would fall directly under its jurisdiction rather than the Crown's."

The Most Serene Republic of Venice employs a complex and convoluted system for electing officials to public office. A series of secret ballots appoints 41 electors, who then each cast a vote into an urn. A single vote is extracted from the urn, and the man whose name is written on it becomes the new Doge. The system attempts to combat electoral corruption and ensure a fair vote."

 #Ideas
 #Bulgaria rework, Dynamo
 bul_idea_1:0 "Nezavisimost"
 bul_idea_1_desc:0 "Bulgaria fractured into multiple principalities in the 14th century before being finally subjugated by the Turks. Yet on this day, we have created a new, free Tsardom, ready to follow in the steps of our forefathers to restore the glory of Bulgaria. No amount of repression has kept our people at bay for at this point we have been able to withstand any blow for the glory of our nation. Svoboda ili smart!"
 bul_idea_2:0 "Bulgarian Orthodox Church"
 bul_idea_2_desc:0 "A fundamental pillar of our society has always been the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the keepers of the faith, the one faith that even in all these troubled centuries kept our people together like nothing else could've. This institution has long been in decline but it is time to reinstate it and propagate the word of God in these lands once again."
 bul_idea_3:0 "Support the Komitadji"
 bul_idea_3_desc:0 "Even though we have secured our independence and unity many of our brethren still remain confined in lands that are not under our direct control. These komitadji, as they are known in our enemy's tongue, deserve our full support in their own struggle for liberation, for their goals match our own and our objective of establishing our rule throughout all of historical Bulgaria is seen as deliverance by our oppressed brothers."
 bul_idea_4:0 "Repopulate the Cities"
 bul_idea_4_desc:0 "The occupiers burned certain cities to the ground and overall led to severe depopulation in Bulgaria due to their monstrous raids against the civilian population. For us to be a regional power once again it is of key importance that we restore our great cities to their former glory, elevating them to the status of centers of learning and production that they possessed centuries ago. People from East and West alike will come to Tarnovo and Sofia to witness the triumph of the Bulgarian state."
 bul_idea_5:0 "Bulgarian National Revival"
 bul_idea_5_desc:0 "The Bulgarian National Revival, also called Bulgarian Renaissance, was a period of period of socio-economic development and national integration for the Bulgarians still living under occupied lands, generally accepted to have begun with the publication of Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya, written in 1762 by Paisius, a Bulgarian monk of the Hilandar monastery at Mount Athos.\n\nInfluenced by Western thinking, the period is remarkable for its characteristic architecture which can still be observed in old Bulgarian towns such as Tryavna, Koprivshtitsa and Veliko Tarnovo, the rich literary heritage of authors like Ivan Vazov and Hristo Botev that inspired the Bulgarian struggle for independence and an autonomous church.. The significant changes in the Bulgarian society, the freedom of economic initiative and religious choice led to the formation of the Bulgarian nation in its ethnic borders and common territory embracing the lands of Moesia, Dobruja, Thrace and Macedonia."
 bul_idea_6:0 "Wrestling For Self-Determination"
 bul_idea_6_desc:0 "Many great powers in Europe and beyond seek to use Bulgaria for their puny goals, from Russia to the Habsburgs to the Ottomans. They act as if they can decide what our borders should be and who we should be allied to. But thanks to our multiple victories in battle against armies that are more technologically advanced than we are, we have showcased them that our will cannot be broken so easily. These battles have allowed us to master new defensive tactics that we can employ against these new artillery pieces being introduced in the battlefield."
 bul_idea_7:0 "Shield of the East"
 bul_idea_7_desc:0 "Our military reputation has risen to the point that the French military has called our own armies the finest of Eastern Europe. It took untold suffering to get to this point but we are now a regional power that can decide politics for the entirety of the Balkans and beyond. Onwards to Victory!"
 
 #USA tweaks, Helena
 empire_of_liberty_desc:0 "From the repressed peoples of South America, to our ravaged by war European brethren, to the victims of terror and those prosecuted for their religion, our fledgling Republic is viewed as an inspiration to the entire human race.

 usa_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'"
 
 #Poland rework, contribution by HotShokomi
 winged_hussars_desc:0 "Originally light cavalry troops used for scouting, the Polish hussars, often called 'Winged Hussars' and affectionately dubbed 'The Angels of Death' by our enemies, have been a part of our party for a while. Donned in a light plate with decorative white feathered wings, they have proven to not only strike fear into our foes but to also inspire our troops to fight on. Their countless successes in battle warrant a larger scale integration into our army to form the core of our new Heavy Shock Cavalry. Their charges shall make the earth tremble and their enemies run before them."
 wojsko_komputoe_desc:0 "Comprising various military units, Wojsko Komputowe (Comput Army) integrated both Polish-born soldiers as well as foreign mercenaries paid by the Diet. Despite a number of funds being instituted by the Diet (with their costs being calculated, or 'computed'), these units were most often paid in part by the Hetman from their own personal wealth during times of peace. Due to the aggressive neighbours of Poland and constant cossack raids, large numbers of troops were maintained at all times and the army was ready to employ mercenaries to replenish their ranks."
