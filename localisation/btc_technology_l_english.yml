 #Korean units
 gakgung_archer:0 "Gakgung Archer" #1
 gakgung_archerDESCR:0 "The Gakgung is a water buffalo horn-based composite reflex bow, standardized centuries ago from a variety of similar weapons in earlier use. Due to its long use by Koreans, it is also known as Guk Gung (meaning National Bow).\n\nThe reflex bow had been the most important weapon for Koreans in wars with Chinese dynasties and nomadic peoples in the north, as recorded from antiquity. The Korean thumb ring is somewhat different from the Manchu, Mongol, or the Turkish Thumb Ring, as it comes in two styles, male and female.\n\nAlso, the arrow is laid on the right side of the bow, unlike the western bow, where the arrow is laid on the left side of the bow."
 hyeopdo_infantry:0 "Hyeopdo Infantry" #1
 hyeopdo_infantryDESCR:0 "The Hyeopdo is a Joseon-era polearm used for both sword training and warfare. It is also called micheomdo, which could be translated as "eyebrow sword" because the curved blade resembled an eyebrow. The pole was around 1.50 meters long and the single-edged blade would be around 63 centimeters.\n\nIt closely resembles the woldo and the Chinese podao, but the Hyeopdo was much easier to handle than the bigger and heavier woldo."
 jangchang_infantry:0 "Jangchang Spearmen" #1
 jangchang_infantryDESCR:0 "The jangchang is a five foot long spear made from the wood of the yew tree. It can also be made from a similarly soft wood, including bamboo in the right climate. It was considered one of the most effective conventional weapon on the battlefield due to its flexibility and length.\n\nSeveral variants existed, such as the The jukjangchang, a twenty foot long spear made of bamboo and tipped with a four inch long blade. The primary advantage of this particular variant was its length and sharp blade, making it suitable for fighting many enemies simultaneously.\n\nThe jangchang was a popular choice because of its ease of construction and simple concept." 
 korean_mounted_archer:0 "Mounted Archers" #1
 korean_mounted_archerDESCR:0 "Korean warfare was often based on harsh terrain and the firepower imposed on the enemy from high ground usually in the form of composite bows and later gunpowder weapons, while cavalry superiority was favored against the constant Jurchen raids during the Joseon dynasty. Fighting against much larger forces as China and Japan, Koreans favored mobility and ranged tactics.\n\nAs a result, even from ancient times the primary type of cavalry utilized by Korean dynasties were mounted archers, excelling in harassment and support roles. The bow remained the main long-range weapon until Japanese invasions in the late 1500s."
 pyeonjeon_archer:0 "Pyeonjeon Archer" #5
 pyeonjeon_archerDESCR:0 "Pyeonjeon (also known as aegisal) is a short arrow or bolt, shot using a longer bamboo arrow guide called the tongah in Korean archery. The tongah (aka "Tong-ah") allows you to draw a short arrow at a full draw length with a full sized bow, it is an overdraw device. A tongah used with a bow looks somewhat similar to a crossbow.\n\nThere are several advantages in shooting a shorter arrow, the shorter arrow is lighter (which means they're faster) and more aerodynamic. They shoot with a higher muzzle velocity which results in greater range and hits the target more quickly. Their speed and small size also made it harder for enemies to see them coming. Their higher speed and aerodynamic efficiency means they penetrate armour better at range. Broken arrows could also be recycled into short arrows.\n\nThe traditional range of this weapon is 350 meters, five times the effective range of Arquebus or Tanegashima. Furthermore, the short bolts had longer range and flatter trajectory with a faster velocity and penetrating power. Thus tongah and pyeonjeon became part of the standard kit for Joseon-era archers."
 hwando_infantry:0 "Hwando Infantry" #5
 hwando_infantryDESCR:0 "The Hwando (meaning "military sword"), is a single-edged sword, in use as the stated sidearm of the Korean soldier well into the 19th century. Sometimes referred to as a "short sword", relative to the out sized two-handed Sangsoodo, its length of 24 to 34 inches is comparable to that of the two-handed Japanese Katana. Forged of carbon steel the Hwando has a single edged, curved blade, a sword guard and a grip, typically of wood.\n\nEarlier practice saw the Hwando suspended from a cord (Jul) and with a simple metal hanger which allowed the soldier to speedily discard his sheath. In later practice, the sword was suspended from a girdle or belt but retained a simple metal quick-release clip."
 keechang_infantry:0 "Keechang Spearmen" #5
 keechang_infantryDESCR:0 "The Kee-Chang is a flag spear, a nine foot long staff with a nine inch long blade at the end. The colored flag, attached at the end of the spear just below the blade, was used to create confusion in battle. Troops surrounded the enemy and waved the flags vigorously during an attack.\n\nIt was also used to encourage the troops, like a rallying cry, in battle. The strength of the keechang was its ability to make deceptive attacks and sudden directional changes to attack the center of the enemy's line."
 woldo_cavalry:0 "Woldo Cavalry" #6
 woldo_cavalryDESCR:0 "The woldo (literally "moon blade"), was a Korean pole weapon that closely resembled the Chinese guandao, though proportionally smaller. It was so named because of its curved blade.\n\nIt usually had a spike on the end of the handle, and a feather or tassel attached by a ring to the back of the blade. There was a variant of the woldo called the danwoldo, which had a bigger blade. Wielding the woldo, because it was heavier than other long-reaching weapons, took time, but, in the hands of a practiced user, the woldo was a fearsome, agile weapon famous for enabling a single soldier to cut down ranks of infantrymen. \n\nIts main use, however, was among horsemen: Korean cavalry, usually in the Joseon, favored the woldo mainly because it was longer than most other pole weapons and for its heavy striking power. Techniques for the use of this weapon in horseback are called Masang woldo."
 pyungon_cavalry:0 "Pyungon Cavalry" #6
 pyungon_cavalryDESCR:0 "The pyungon is a flail, an eight foot long staff with a two foot long club attached to the end of it by a chain or metal ring. The pyun gon looks similar to a nunchaku except that one segment is much longer than the other whereas the nuchaku's sticks are equal in length.\n\nThis weapon excelled in defense and was used in some of the sieges during the Imjin War where it was often used to club enemies attempting to scale the walls of a castle or fortress. The pyungon used on horseback has a longer chain than that used by the infantry, allowing the mounted combatant to strike enemies on the ground. The stick at the end of the chain is studded with iron nails or other sharp protrusions to inflict fatal wounds on impact."
 deungpae_infantry:0 "Deung Pae Infantry" #9
 deungpae_infantryDESCR:0 "The deung pae is the sword and shield art. The sword, used for attacking, was primarily a short sword, such as the yo do. The shield was three feet seven inches in diameter and was most commonly made of woven wisteria branches (in the south) or willow branches wrapped in leather (in the north). It was used by the infantry to defend against a variety of weapons including the dart spear and bird gun.\n\nIn the classic Korean martial art manuals the use of the deung pae is explained in combination with both the spear and the sword. Often a soldier would hold the deungpae and sword in the dominant hand, while holding a spear in his other hand. The spear would be thrown at the opponent, after which the soldier would attack with his sword."
 seungja_chongtong:0 "Seungja-Chongtong Hand Cannoneer" #9
 seungja_chongtongDESCR:0 "The Chongtong is the term for Joseon-era gunnery. There were many different types, various improvements over the years, often including renaming. The Seungja-Chongtong ('Victor') is an example of a handheld cannon that was utilized by Joseon infantry starting in the 16th century.\n\nIt improved the disadvantages of the original rifles of the Joseon era that were made during the reign of King Sejong, and made the gun's beak longer to increase the range and accuracy. Compared to the large firearms used at sea, this weapon was mainly used on land combat and contributed greatly in defeating the Jurchen in the north. Its maximum range with a dart was about 740 m."
 se_chongtong_cavalry:0 "Se-Chongtong Cavalry" #10
 se_chongtong_cavalryDESCR:0 "During the 16th century the Joseon dynasty experimented with a series of hand cannons, one of which was the Se-Chongton ('Thin'). This earlier model, made during the reign of King Sejong, was not quite as effective as the more well known Seungja-Chongtong, but was considerably lighter and thus well suited to be used by cavalry units and by younger warriors. The development of miniaturized firearms that are easy to carry and launch represents the fact that the firearms have been expanded not only for fighting but also for marching. Just like the Seunga-Chongtong, the se-chongtong was revived and used during the wars against the Jurchen tribes in the north."
 paekcha_chong:0 "Paekcha-Ch'ong Handgonnes" #12
 paekcha_chongDESCR:0 "The Chongtong cannons continued to be used well into the Imjin War, although they were not nearly as effective as the Japanese arquebuses. Among the few weapons of foreign origin in use in Korea at this time were the large 'Paekcha-Ch'ong' Handgonnes, which were used as gingalls or wall guns. These reinforced a theme of Korean military of trying to hold on to strategically important military fortresses using a wide variety of weapon types."
 early_jochong_infantry:0 "Early Jochong Infantry" #12
 early_jochong_infantryDESCR:0 "The Arquebus was introduced to the Far East in the middle of the 16th century through Portuguese traders. While Japan was quick to adopt this new weapon in its arsenal, the Koreans had a more conservative approach towards their army and continued to largely rely on archers and their Chongtong line of cannons. Nonetheless, a few of these weapons were acquired during this time through trade and conflicts with pirates, allowing for some mixed formations of archers and musketeers."
 early_jochong_cavalry:0 "Early Jochong Cavalry" #14
 early_jochong_cavalryDESCR:0 "By the beginning of the Aijin War, Korean cavalry still relied largely on the tried-and-true method of employing mounted archers on the battlefield. These however proved ineffective: most of cavalry action for the Koreans took place in the Battle of Chungju at the beginning of the war, where they were outnumbered and wiped out by Japanese infantry. Some of the imported muskets would be tried on cavalry units in the 16th century but it wouldn't be until later that they became standardized."
 jochong_experimental_infantry:0 "Jochong Experimental Infantry" #15
 jochong_experimental_infantryDESCR:0 "As the Imjin War progressed, the Koreans relied mostly on stolen Japanese equipment for their arquebuses, and the conservative military still favored the ancient and noble field of archery. King Seonjo (r. 1567–1608), however, became a "zealous proponent" of the musket. King Seonjo ordered that Japanese musketeers be captured alive so they could instruct the Koreans, and he established a new standing army called the Military Training Agency, whose core units were musketeers. King Seonjo's interest in the musket extended even to design: he developed a rapid-fire version himself."
 jochong_mass_infantry:0 "Jochong Mass Infantry" #15
 jochong_mass_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Imjin War, the Koreans were at a disadvantage against the Japanese invaders, who were using Arquebuses introduced by Portuguese traders. During the course of the war however the Koreans began scavenging and producing some of these weapons for their own in the later stages of the war, albeit on a much smaller scale than Japan. These weapons were known to the Koreans as Jochong and the infantry units using them were the first musketeers in the history of the peninsula, setting the stage for significant reforms in the decades to come, although the Chongtgon hand cannons would continue to be used during the 17th century because cannons and arquebuses were impractical to transport in the mountainous regions where the Jurchen were fought."
 jochong_cavalry:0 "Jochong Cavalry" #17
 jochong_cavalryDESCR:0 "The inclusion of firearms into the Joseon army continued at a steady pace during and after the Imjin War. Although the battles against Japan showcased the ineffectiveness of conventional cavalry archer units, the Koreans would end up using cavalry once again when the Jurchen tribes in the north became more hostile. In these new conflicts favoring mobility, the Jochong weapons were thus also used for cavarly formations, meant to fire at charging Manchu cavalry from a distance."
 korean_volley_fire_musketeers:0 "Volley Fire Musketeers" #19
 korean_volley_fire_musketeersDESCR:0 "Starting from the 17th century, Korean musketeers were trained in Qi Jiguang's volley technique. A Korean drill manual of 1607, based closely on Qi Jiguang's Ji xiao xin shu, notes that 'every musketeer squad should either divide into two musketeers per layer or one and deliver fire in five volleys or in ten.' Korean military manuals filled in the blanks, interpreting, explaining, and commenting on the Qi manuals. They even contain diagrams that present the clearest explanation of the East Asian musketry volley technique that has yet been discovered."
 korean_mounted_musketeers:0 "Mounted Musketeers" #23
 korean_mounted_musketeersDESCR:0 "Following heavy losses inflicted on their cavalry units first by the Japanese, then by the Manchus, the Korean cavalry divisions fell into decline and became somewhat relegated to ceremonial and training purposes. Several of the cavalry units that still operated at this point, however, learned to balance fighting on horseback and fighting on foot, dismounting when engaged in action, acting more as mounted infantry. This significantly increased their effectiveness."
 taeduin_infantry:0 "Taeduin Infantry" #26
 taeduin_infantryDESCR:0 "Following the devastating wars with Japan and the Manchus, in the seventeenth the Korean military underwent a series of significant military reforms to modernize its army. Now fielding several deadly Musketeer divisions, during the middle of the 1650s Joseon came to the aid of the newly established Qing dynasty who was facing off against Russian invaders from the north: Dubbed as 'Big Heads' (taeduin) for their distinctive helmets, these musketeers were excellent marksmen. During the Northern Expeditions of 1654 and 1658, their musketry fire broke through Russian ranks and helped thwart Cossack intrusion into the inner reaches of the Amur region."
 taeduin_cavalry:0 "Taeduin Cavalry" #28
 taeduin_cavalryDESCR:0 "Fighting against the Cossack in the steppes north of Korea, mobility continued to be key in the seventeenth century and so cavalry transportation for the powerful Taeduin infantry was more than a necessity. Although ceremonial cavalry continued to be largely archers, musketeer cavalry was well established by this point."
 gwangmu_reformed_infantry:0 "Gwangmu Reformed Infantry" #30
 gwangmu_reformed_infantryDESCR:0 "The Gwangmu Reform (Gwangmu Gaehyeok) of the 19th century was a chain of events that was aimed at modernizing and westernizing the Korean Empire as a late starter in the industrial revolution. The reform that took place during the Gwangmu Era from 1897 to 1907 showed, in the long term, Korean potential for starting and continuing modernization, even in the face of adversity. The Gwangmu reform of Emperor Gojong later staged the fundamental background for future Korean development by building infrastructure, reforming the economy and creating the nucleus of the modern bureaucracy and military.\n\nDuring this time, Western-style official uniforms were introduced in Korea. At the start, the Korean Emperor had begun to wear Prussian-style royal attire along with Korean diplomats, who wore Western suits. In 1900, Western attire became the official uniform for the Korean civil officials. Several years later, all Korean soldiers and policemen were assigned to wear Western uniforms. Training by Russian and German officers began. The Yeonmu-gongwon, the first modern military academy, was established and even employed American instructors. The result of all these reforms were powerful infantry divisions very much comparable to their western counterparts."

It was made up mostly of ethnic Han soldiers and operated concurrently with the Manchu-Mongol-Han Eight Banner armies.\n\nThe original Green Standard troops were the soldiers of the Ming commanders who surrendered to the Qing in 1644 and after. Their troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service; they usually came from the socially disadvantaged, and remained segregated from Chinese society, partly because of the latter's deep anti-military bias during the late Ming period, and partly because they were paid too poorly and irregularly to marry and support a family.\n\nMany of these defected Ming troops moved to Japan during war time through the active port of Nagasaki where Tokugawa shogunate traded with China, though majority of ethnic Han soldiers were loyal to Qing."
