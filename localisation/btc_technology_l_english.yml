 #Korean units
 gakgung_archer:0 "Gakgung Archer" #1
 gakgung_archerDESCR:0 "The Gakgung is a water buffalo horn-based composite reflex bow, standardized centuries ago from a variety of similar weapons in earlier use. Due to its long use by Koreans, it is also known as Guk Gung (meaning National Bow).\n\nThe reflex bow had been the most important weapon for Koreans in wars with Chinese dynasties and nomadic peoples in the north, as recorded from antiquity. The Korean thumb ring is somewhat different from the Manchu, Mongol, or the Turkish Thumb Ring, as it comes in two styles, male and female.\n\nAlso, the arrow is laid on the right side of the bow, unlike the western bow, where the arrow is laid on the left side of the bow."
 hyeopdo_infantry:0 "Hyeopdo Infantry" #1
 hyeopdo_infantryDESCR:0 "The Hyeopdo is a Joseon-era polearm used for both sword training and warfare. It is also called micheomdo, which could be translated as "eyebrow sword" because the curved blade resembled an eyebrow. The pole was around 1.50 meters long and the single-edged blade would be around 63 centimeters.\n\nIt closely resembles the woldo and the Chinese podao, but the Hyeopdo was much easier to handle than the bigger and heavier woldo."
 jangchang_infantry:0 "Jangchang Spearmen" #1
 jangchang_infantryDESCR:0 "The jangchang is a five foot long spear made from the wood of the yew tree. It can also be made from a similarly soft wood, including bamboo in the right climate. It was considered one of the most effective conventional weapon on the battlefield due to its flexibility and length.\n\nSeveral variants existed, such as the The jukjangchang, a twenty foot long spear made of bamboo and tipped with a four inch long blade. The primary advantage of this particular variant was its length and sharp blade, making it suitable for fighting many enemies simultaneously.\n\nThe jangchang was a popular choice because of its ease of construction and simple concept." 
 korean_mounted_archer:0 "Mounted Archers" #1
 korean_mounted_archerDESCR:0 "Korean warfare was often based on harsh terrain and the firepower imposed on the enemy from high ground usually in the form of composite bows and later gunpowder weapons, while cavalry superiority was favored against the constant Jurchen raids during the Joseon dynasty. Fighting against much larger forces as China and Japan, Koreans favored mobility and ranged tactics.\n\nAs a result, even from ancient times the primary type of cavalry utilized by Korean dynasties were mounted archers, excelling in harassment and support roles. The bow remained the main long-range weapon until Japanese invasions in the late 1500s."
 pyeonjeon_archer:0 "Pyeonjeon Archer" #5
 pyeonjeon_archerDESCR:0 "Pyeonjeon (also known as aegisal) is a short arrow or bolt, shot using a longer bamboo arrow guide called the tongah in Korean archery. The tongah (aka "Tong-ah") allows you to draw a short arrow at a full draw length with a full sized bow, it is an overdraw device. A tongah used with a bow looks somewhat similar to a crossbow.\n\nThere are several advantages in shooting a shorter arrow, the shorter arrow is lighter (which means they're faster) and more aerodynamic. They shoot with a higher muzzle velocity which results in greater range and hits the target more quickly. Their speed and small size also made it harder for enemies to see them coming. Their higher speed and aerodynamic efficiency means they penetrate armour better at range. Broken arrows could also be recycled into short arrows.\n\nThe traditional range of this weapon is 350 meters, five times the effective range of Arquebus or Tanegashima. Furthermore, the short bolts had longer range and flatter trajectory with a faster velocity and penetrating power. Thus tongah and pyeonjeon became part of the standard kit for Joseon-era archers."
 hwando_infantry:0 "Hwando Infantry" #5
 hwando_infantryDESCR:0 "The Hwando (meaning "military sword"), is a single-edged sword, in use as the stated sidearm of the Korean soldier well into the 19th century. Sometimes referred to as a "short sword", relative to the out sized two-handed Sangsoodo, its length of 24 to 34 inches is comparable to that of the two-handed Japanese Katana. Forged of carbon steel the Hwando has a single edged, curved blade, a sword guard and a grip, typically of wood.\n\nEarlier practice saw the Hwando suspended from a cord (Jul) and with a simple metal hanger which allowed the soldier to speedily discard his sheath. In later practice, the sword was suspended from a girdle or belt but retained a simple metal quick-release clip."
 keechang_infantry:0 "Keechang Spearmen" #5
 keechang_infantryDESCR:0 "The Kee-Chang is a flag spear, a nine foot long staff with a nine inch long blade at the end. The colored flag, attached at the end of the spear just below the blade, was used to create confusion in battle. Troops surrounded the enemy and waved the flags vigorously during an attack.\n\nIt was also used to encourage the troops, like a rallying cry, in battle. The strength of the keechang was its ability to make deceptive attacks and sudden directional changes to attack the center of the enemy's line."
 woldo_cavalry:0 "Woldo Cavalry" #6
 woldo_cavalryDESCR:0 "The woldo (literally “moon blade”), was a Korean pole weapon that closely resembled the Chinese guandao, though proportionally smaller. It was so named because of its curved blade.\n\nIt usually had a spike on the end of the handle, and a feather or tassel attached by a ring to the back of the blade. There was a variant of the woldo called the danwoldo, which had a bigger blade. Wielding the woldo, because it was heavier than other long-reaching weapons, took time, but, in the hands of a practised user, the woldo was a fearsome, agile weapon famous for enabling a single soldier to cut down ranks of infantrymen. \n\nIts main use, however, was among horsemen: Korean cavalry, usually in the Joseon, favored the woldo mainly because it was longer than most other pole weapons and for its heavy striking power. Techniques for the use of this weapon in horseback are called Masang woldo."
 pyungon_cavalry:0 "Pyungon Cavalry" #6
 pyungon_cavalryDESCR:0 "The pyungon is a flail, an eight foot long staff with a two foot long club attached to the end of it by a chain or metal ring. The pyun gon looks similar to a nunchaku except that one segment is much longer than the other whereas the nuchaku's sticks are equal in length.\n\nThis weapon excelled in defense and was used in some of the sieges during the Imjin War where it was often used to club enemies attempting to scale the walls of a castle or fortress. The pyungon used on horseback has a longer chain than that used by the infantry, allowing the mounted combatant to strike enemies on the ground. The stick at the end of the chain is studded with iron nails or other sharp protrusions to inflict fatal wounds on impact."
 deungpae_infantry:0 "Deung Pae Infantry" #9
 deungpae_infantryDESCR:0 "The deung pae is the sword and shield art. The sword, used for attacking, was primarily a short sword, such as the yo do. The shield was three feet seven inches in diameter and was most commonly made of woven wisteria branches (in the south) or willow branches wrapped in leather (in the north). It was used by the infantry to defend against a variety of weapons including the dart spear and bird gun.\n\nIn the classic Korean martial art manuals the use of the deung pae is explained in combination with both the spear and the sword. Often a soldier would hold the deungpae and sword in the dominant hand, while holding a spear in his other hand. The spear would be thrown at the opponent, after which the soldier would attack with his sword."
 seungja_chongtong:0 "Seungja-Chongtong Hand Cannoneer" #9
 seungja_chongtongDESCR:0 "The Chongtong is the term for Joseon-era gunnery. There were many different types, various improvements over the years, often including renaming. The Seungja-Chongtong ('Victor') is an example of a handheld cannon that was utilized by Joseon infantry starting in the 16th century.\n\nIt improved the disadvantages of the original rifles of the Joseon era that were made during the reign of King Sejong, and made the gun's beak longer to increase the range and accuracy. Compared to the large firearms used at sea, this weapon was mainly used on land combat and contributed greatly in defeating the Jurchen in the north. Its maximum range with a dart was about 740 m."
 se_chongtong_cavalry:0 "Se-Chongtong Cavalry" #10
 se_chongtong_cavalryDESCR:0 "During the 16th century the Joseon dynasty experimented with a series of hand cannons, one of which was the Se-Chongton ('Thin'). This earlier model, made during the reign of King Sejong, was not quite as effective as the more well known Seungja-Chongtong, but was considerably lighter and thus well suited to be used by cavalry units and by younger warriors. The development of miniaturized firearms that are easy to carry and launch represents the fact that the firearms have been expanded not only for fighting but also for marching. Just like the Seunga-Chongtong, the se-chongtong was revived and used during the wars against the Jurchen tribes in the north."
 paekcha_chong:0 "Paekcha-Ch'ong Handgonnes" #12
 paekcha_chongDESCR:0 "The Chongtong cannons continued to be used well into the Imjin War, although they were not nearly as effective as the Japanese arquebuses. Among the few weapons of foreign origin in use in Korea at this time were the large 'Paekcha-Ch'ong' Handgonnes, which were used as gingalls or wall guns. These reinforced a theme of Korean military of trying to hold on to strategically important military fortresses using a wide variety of weapon types."
 early_jochong_infantry:0 "Early Jochong Infantry" #12
 early_jochong_infantryDESCR:0 "The Arquebus was introduced to the Far East in the middle of the 16th century through Portuguese traders. While Japan was quick to adopt this new weapon in its arsenal, the Koreans had a more conservative approach towards their army and continued to largely rely on archers and their Chongtong line of cannons. Nonetheless, a few of these weapons were acquired during this time through trade and conflicts with pirates, allowing for some mixed formations of archers and musketeers."
 early_jochong_cavalry:0 "Early Jochong Cavalry" #14
 early_jochong_cavalryDESCR:0 "By the beginning of the Aijin War, Korean cavalry still relied largely on the tried-and-true method of employing mounted archers on the battlefield. These however proved ineffective: most of cavalry action for the Koreans took place in the Battle of Chungju at the beginning of the war, where they were outnumbered and wiped out by Japanese infantry. Some of the imported muskets would be tried on cavalry units in the 16th century but it wouldn't be until later that they became standardized."
 jochong_experimental_infantry:0 "Jochong Experimental Infantry" #15
 jochong_experimental_infantryDESCR:0 "As the Imjin War progressed, the Koreans relied mostly on stolen Japanese equipment for their arquebuses, and the conservative military still favored the ancient and noble field of archery. King Seonjo (r. 1567–1608), however, became a “zealous proponent” of the musket. King Seonjo ordered that Japanese musketeers be captured alive so they could instruct the Koreans, and he established a new standing army called the Military Training Agency, whose core units were musketeers. King Seonjo's interest in the musket extended even to design: he developed a rapid-fire version himself."
 jochong_mass_infantry:0 "Jochong Mass Infantry" #15
 jochong_mass_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Imjin War, the Koreans were at a disadvantage against the Japanese invaders, who were using Arquebuses introduced by Portuguese traders. During the course of the war however the Koreans began scavenging and producing some of these weapons for their own in the later stages of the war, albeit on a much smaller scale than Japan. These weapons were known to the Koreans as Jochong and the infantry units using them were the first musketeers in the history of the peninsula, setting the stage for significant reforms in the decades to come, although the Chongtgon hand cannons would continue to be used during the 17th century because cannons and arquebuses were impractical to transport in the mountainous regions where the Jurchen were fought."
 jochong_cavalry:0 "Jochong Cavalry" #17
 jochong_cavalryDESCR:0 "The inclusion of firearms into the Joseon army continued at a steady pace during and after the Imjin War. Although the battles against Japan showcased the ineffectiveness of conventional cavalry archer units, the Koreans would end up using cavalry once again when the Jurchen tribes in the north became more hostile. In these new conflicts favoring mobility, the Jochong weapons were thus also used for cavarly formations, meant to fire at charging Manchu cavalry from a distance."
 korean_volley_fire_musketeers:0 "Volley Fire Musketeers" #19
 korean_volley_fire_musketeersDESCR:0 "Starting from the 17th century, Korean musketeers were trained in Qi Jiguang's volley technique. A Korean drill manual of 1607, based closely on Qi Jiguang's Ji xiao xin shu, notes that 'every musketeer squad should either divide into two musketeers per layer or one and deliver fire in five volleys or in ten.' Korean military manuals filled in the blanks, interpreting, explaining, and commenting on the Qi manuals. They even contain diagrams that present the clearest explanation of the East Asian musketry volley technique that has yet been discovered."
 korean_mounted_musketeers:0 "Mounted Musketeers" #23
 korean_mounted_musketeersDESCR:0 "Following heavy losses inflicted on their cavalry units first by the Japanese, then by the Manchus, the Korean cavalry divisions fell into decline and became somewhat relegated to ceremonial and training purposes. Several of the cavalry units that still operated at this point, however, learned to balance fighting on horseback and fighting on foot, dismounting when engaged in action, acting more as mounted infantry. This significantly increased their effectiveness."
 taeduin_infantry:0 "Taeduin Infantry" #26
 taeduin_infantryDESCR:0 "Following the devastating wars with Japan and the Manchus, in the seventeenth the Korean military underwent a series of significant military reforms to modernize its army. Now fielding several deadly Musketeer divisions, during the middle of the 1650s Joseon came to the aid of the newly established Qing dynasty who was facing off against Russian invaders from the north: Dubbed as 'Big Heads' (taeduin) for their distinctive helmets, these musketeers were excellent marksmen. During the Northern Expeditions of 1654 and 1658, their musketry fire broke through Russian ranks and helped thwart Cossack intrusion into the inner reaches of the Amur region."
 taeduin_cavalry:0 "Taeduin Cavalry" #28
 taeduin_cavalryDESCR:0 "Fighting against the Cossack in the steppes north of Korea, mobility continued to be key in the seventeenth century and so cavalry transportation for the powerful Taeduin infantry was more than a necessity. Although ceremonial cavalry continued to be largely archers, musketeer cavalry was well established by this point."
 gwangmu_reformed_infantry:0 "Gwangmu Reformed Infantry" #30
 gwangmu_reformed_infantryDESCR:0 "The Gwangmu Reform (Gwangmu Gaehyeok) of the 19th century was a chain of events that was aimed at modernizing and westernizing the Korean Empire as a late starter in the industrial revolution. The reform that took place during the Gwangmu Era from 1897 to 1907 showed, in the long term, Korean potential for starting and continuing modernisation, even in the face of adversity. The Gwangmu reform of Emperor Gojong later staged the fundamental background for future Korean development by building infrastructure, reforming the economy and creating the nucleus of the modern bureaucracy and military.\n\nDuring this time, Western-style official uniforms were introduced in Korea. At the start, the Korean Emperor had begun to wear Prussian-style royal attire along with Korean diplomats, who wore Western suits. In 1900, Western attire became the official uniform for the Korean civil officials. Several years later, all Korean soldiers and policemen were assigned to wear Western uniforms. Training by Russian and German officers began. The Yeonmu-gongwon, the first modern military academy, was established and even employed American instructors. The result of all these reforms were powerful infantry divisions very much comparable to their western counterparts."

It was made up mostly of ethnic Han soldiers and operated concurrently with the Manchu-Mongol-Han Eight Banner armies.\n\nThe original Green Standard troops were the soldiers of the Ming commanders who surrendered to the Qing in 1644 and after. Their troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service; they usually came from the socially disadvantaged, and remained segregated from Chinese society, partly because of the latter's deep anti-military bias during the late Ming period, and partly because they were paid too poorly and irregularly to marry and support a family.\n\nMany of these defected Ming troops moved to Japan during war time through the active port of Nagasaki where Tokugawa shogunate traded with China, though majority of ethnic Han soldiers were loyal to Qing."

Thus, even though for years the Mamluks had resisted any attempts at modernizing their military traditions, they were forced to try and adopt arquebuses almost overnight.

In that period Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli came under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the Barbary States. Similar raids were undertaken from Salé and other ports in Morocco. These African cities, although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, were in fact military republics that chose their own rulers and lived by war booty captured from the Christian nations in the Mediterranean and even in the Atlantic Ocean.

Their enemies had great difficulty besieging their mountain strongholds and they conducted protracted raids and even direct engagements which proved devastating against the Turks. The reasons behind the Zaidiyyah successes were the tribes' possession of firearms and the fact that they had managed to unite a plurality of the tribes - previously long-time regional rivals - under the same banner. Their efficacy was such that an Ottoman commander remarked: 'We have seen no foundry like Yemen for our soldiers.

The local Arab rulers found themselves unable to withstand the powerful Portuguese navy and cannons, and despite repeated revolts they were forced to submit to Portuguese rule for decades. Things started to change at the beginning of the 17th century as the Ottomans and Safavids took a greater interest in expelling the Portuguese from their domains. The two Empires started providing the Arab forces of the Persian Gulf with logistical support and modern weaponry, which finally allowed the revolts to challenge Portuguese control of the region, allowing local Arabs to conquer the fort in Bahrain in 1602 and eventually leading up to the Portuguese departure from Hormuz in 1622."

In essence these were privileged groups established by a sultan to guarantee continued loyalty of Arab and Berber tribes in the realm, because they had a long history of independence and could change sides or desert him at any moment. In part due to this state of permanent mobilization, usually for defensive purposes, but sometimes offensive, jaysh tribes were exempted from import taxes in order to compensate them and were given land in exchange for their troops. These jaysh' were decentralized, and leadership was often tribal in nature. This system was greatly expanded by the great Moroccan sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif, under whom many new units were organized.\n\nIn the southern center of the country, these jaysh were formed from rural Arabs, as well as Berber tribes of the plains of the Middle Atlas and the High Atlas. In the north, Berber Riffian jaysh came to dominate, with Riffian armies used against the Spanish-governed cities on the Moroccan coast."

Representing the highest degree of autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty up to that point, he had managed to impose a quasi-monarchical authority over Egypt. The prestige of this emir was reinforced by a flattering genealogy that linked him to the great Mamluk sultans Barquq and Barsbay, and even to the Quraysh tribe of the Prophet, a claim that Barsbay had also made.

The election of Nasir bin Murshid Al-Ya'rubi as Imam of Oman in 1624 changed the balance of power again in the region, from the Persians and the Portuguese to local Omanis.\n\nNasir was able to unify the tribes with a common goal of expelling the Portuguese, who had taken control of the coastal cities of Sur, Qurayyat, Muscat and Sohar. Hostilities began around 1633, when Nasir raised a large army that he dispatched in an unsuccessful attempt to take Muscat. Nasir next dispatched an army against Julfar. This port was defended by two forts, one manned by the Safavids and the other by the Portuguese. Both forts were captured and the Safavids were ejected. On August 16, 1648 the Imam dispatched an army to Muscat, which captured and demolished the high towers of the Portuguese, weakening their grip over the town. Decisively, under his cousin and successor, Sultan bin Saif, the city was attacked again in 1650 in the middle of the night, finally forcing the Portuguese to leave Muscat. The united tribal forces had thus secured Omani independence from foreigners and their military prowess set the stage for the subsequent Omani colonial empire."

The Sultans of Oman, having successfully repeled Portuguese and Safavid incursions into their territory, moved on to besiege several Portuguese forts scattered throughout East Africa, from Mombasa in Africa to Gwadar in India.\n\nBy this point the Omanis possessed an exceptionally powerful navy and modern weaponry, part of which was taken by the Portuguese and Safavid garrisons and part of which was commissioned by Omani rulers to weaponsmiths overseas. The Omani military thus proved not only able to best their former colonial overlords but also managed to subdue many revolts in their overseas possessions, oftentimes caused by friction between local Sunni rulers and the Kharijite Omans."

 bani_khalid_warriorDESCR:0 "From the second half of the 17th century the Bani Khalid tribal confederation, which already dominated the deserts surrounding the Al-Hasa and Al-Qatif in eastern Arabia, had managed to expel Ottoman forces from the cities and towns in 1670 and proclaim their rule over the region as well as southern Iraq. Their rule represented the epitome of Bedouin self-rule in northern Iraq and eastern Arabia before the arrival of Mamluk rule in Iraq and the rise of the Wahhabi Emirate of Diriyah, against whom the Bani Khalid would wage a protracted conflict up until the tail end of the 18th century."

 maghrebi_musketeerDESCR:0 "The 18th century for the Maghreb represented the beginning of the detachment from the traditional Ottoman sphere of influence, as the Turks were no longer able to effectively exercise control over the already quite autonomous Barbary states, coupled with their failure to subdue Sultan of Morocco in the west. Discord in these states followed initially, but eventually a certain degree of stability and prosperity was achieved through increased trade with Europe and an integration of the rural population into regional networks.\n\nThus for the first time in centuries most of the Maghrebi nations no longer could count on the Janissary garrisons for protection but had to increasingly rely on their own men and militia to protect their lands from foreign conquerors."

 zanzibari_gunnerDESCR:0 "The crown jewel of the the Omani overseas holdings was undoubtedly the archipelago of Zanzibar off the Swahili Coast. After centuries of Portuguese rule the Omanis conquered the island at the start of the 18th century and established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour, whilst allowing merchants from the Indian subcontinent to monopolize trade. The Omani court itself moved from Muscat to Stone Town on the island of Unguja, until the realms were separated again in the 19th century.\n\nOman thus became the principal power on the Swahili Coast for up to a century, managing to secure independence form Europeans and obtain suzerainty over several of the coastal kingdoms. Zanzibari military forces were equipped with matchlock rifles, swords and rhino shields and would prove decisive in the continued defense of the islands."

 wahhabi_warriorDESCR:0 "The doctrine of Wahhabism started as a religious movement in the remote, sparsely populated region of Najd, and it advocated a purging of such widespread Sunni practices as the veneration of saints and the visiting of their tombs and shrines, that were practiced all over the Islamic world, for they were considered considered idolatrous impurities and innovations in Islam.\n\nThe founder, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, formed a pact with a local leader, Muhammad bin Saud, offering political obedience and promising that protection and propagation of the Wahhabi movement meant "power and glory" and rule of "lands and men". This religious movement began spreading wide in the Najd region and conflicted with many neighboring powers, and was to play an important role in the later history of Islam."

 egyptian_gunnerDESCR:0 "The takeover of Egypt by Muhammad Ali led to an unprecedented rise in power and importance for the region after centuries of decline and stagnation under Ottoman control. He brought Mamluk rule to an end by luring and massacring most of them in the citadel of Cairo, and inaugurated a modern military for Egypt involving conscripted locals, though much of the military higher ranks remained Turkic.\n\nAmong his impressive military achievements were the construction of factories based in Cairo, which produced muskets and cannons, which by the 1830s were turning out 1,600 muskets a month; he sent promising citizens to Europe to study and encouraged them to learn foreign languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic; the innovative military methods of conscription and mass drill then being implemented in European armies were studied and successfully replicated by Muhammad Ali.\n\nThis proved crucial as, when he finally revolted against the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman armies had not yet successfully modernized their armies to such an extent, leading to a catastrophic defeat for the Ottoman forces and granting Egypt a status of importance on the world stage once again."
 iraqi_mamluk:0 "Iraqi Mamluk" #30
 iraqi_mamlukDESCR:0 "Mamluk rule in Iraq, lasting from the early 18th to the middle 19th century, represented a shift from the largely tribal and rural reality of the Ottoman rule, as the region had never truly recovered from the destruction brought from the Mongol invasions and the continued Ottoman-Persian confrontations. The Mamluk ruling elite, composed mainly of Georgians, Circassians and other ethnic groups from the Caucasus, succeeded in asserting autonomy from their Ottoman overlords, and restored order and some degree of economic prosperity in the region.\n\nBy the 1810s, they had pursued important modernization programs that included clearing canals, establishing industries, reforming the army with the help of European instructors, and founding a printing press.\n\nThough fraught with the familiar infighting that characterized all Mamluk states, the Mamluks from Iraq proved adept at resisting their many enemies which included, apart from the Ottomans, also Arab and Kurdish tribes as well as the looming threat from Persia. Nominal Mamluk rule would end in 1836, but this didn't stop their continued dominance over the socio-political aspect in Iraq, as most of the administrative personnel of note in Baghdad were drawn from former Mamluk households."

 reformed_maghrebi_infantryDESCR:0 "By the 19th century, declining Ottoman influence and increased European interest in the region had changed the geopolitical outlook in the Maghreb, as nations became increasingly distant from the Ottomans while contacts with Europe increased. The Barbary raids at this time largely stopped following European pressure, and trade and military cooperation increased.\n\nLocal rulers such as the sultans of Morocco or the beys of Tunis employed European engineers and even sent some of their men in Europe to study their art of warfare in order to modernize their armies. The result was the formation of the modern states of the Maghreb and the presence of military forces capable of withstanding foreign incursions and resisting European colonization, at least for a time."
